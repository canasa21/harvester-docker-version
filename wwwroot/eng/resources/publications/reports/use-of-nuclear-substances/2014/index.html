For each nuclear industry sector described in this report, CNSC  staff conduct inspections, assessments, reviews and evaluations of licensee  programs, processes and safety performance.</p>  <p>CNSC staff use a well-established safety and control area  (SCA) framework in evaluating each licensee's safety performance. The framework  includes 14 SCAs covering all technical areas of regulatory oversight. Each SCA  is subdivided into specific areas that define its key components. For the  purpose of this report, safety performance is measured by examining:</p>  <ul>
<li>licensees' regulatory compliance in select SCAs</li>
<li>occupational doses to workers</li>
<li>reported events </li>  </ul>  <p>In 2014, as part of their ongoing regulatory oversight of  licensees, CNSC staff conducted compliance verification activities consisting  of field inspections, desktop reviews and technical assessments of licensee  activities. The evaluations of findings for the SCAs covered in this report  show that, overall, licensees made adequate provisions for the protection of  the health, safety and security of persons and the environment from the use of  nuclear substances, and took the measures required to implement Canada's international  obligations. Based on this, CNSC staff conclude that the use of nuclear  substances in Canada is safe.</p>  <h3>Occupational doses to workers</h3>  <p>Persons engaged in CNSC-licensed activities may be  occupationally exposed to radiation. Regulatory compliance with radiation  protection programs established under the CNSC licences ensures that licensees  keep radiation doses to persons below CNSC regulatory limits and as low as reasonably  achievable (ALARA). This ensures that there are no adverse impacts as a result  of occupational doses. In 2014, doses were monitored for 60,407 workers in the four nuclear industry  sectors and two high-energy research particle accelerator facilities  covered in this report. Of these workers, 23,688 were designated as nuclear energy workers (NEWs). </p>  <p>In 2014, workers' occupational exposures to radiation continued  to be very low. More than 99.9% of the 60,407 workers received doses below their  applicable regulatory dose limits. This followed a trend consistent with previous  reporting years. No NEWs exceeded the one- or five-year dose limits of 50 millisieverts  (mSv) or 100 mSv, respectively. </p>  <p>There were two separate situations where, based on dosimetry  results, workers (who were not NEWs) exceeded the annual regulatory dose limit  of 1 mSv. In both situations, licensees responded in accordance with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations.</em> Neither  situation resulted in any immediate adverse health consequences to the workers.</p>  <h3>Inspections</h3>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC conducted 1,453 inspections across the four  nuclear industry sectors (medical, industrial, academic and research, and  commercial) and the two high-energy research particle accelerator facilities. Licensees  showed satisfactory compliance ratings in the operating performance, radiation  protection and security SCAs. Non-compliances identified during inspections are systematically tracked until  licensees have addressed them to the satisfaction of the CNSC. </p>  <ul>
<li>Operating performance: Licensees continued to make adequate provisions for the health,  safety and security of persons, and protection of the environment. Licensees continued  to demonstrate good performance within this SCA, with improvements since 2010 in  the medical and industrial sectors. CNSC staff found that 88.4% of inspected  licensees have satisfactory regulatory compliance.</li>
<li>Radiation protection: Licensees continued to ensure that exposure of workers  and the public to ionizing radiation remains ALARA. In general, licensees  continued to demonstrate good performance within this SCA, with steady  improvements since 2010 among all four sectors. CNSC staff found that 89.1% of  inspected licensees have satisfactory regulatory compliance.</li>
<li>Security: Licensees demonstrated that they have adequate provisions  in place to prevent the loss,  sabotage, illegal use, illegal possession or illegal removal of sealed sources  in their care and control. Overall, 94.8% of inspected licensees were found  to be in regulatory compliance with this SCA.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Enforcement actions</h3>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC took escalated compliance enforcement  actions in 19 instances, including the issuance of 12 orders and seven&nbsp;administrative  monetary penalties, to ensure that the health and safety of workers, the  Canadian public and the environment were being adequately protected. Most of  the enforcement actions were taken against licensees in the industrial sector, consistent  with trends from previous years. All licensees to whom orders were issued have  implemented corrective measures, which were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to  be satisfactory. All seven administrative monetary penalties issued for the  four nuclear industry sectors covered in this report have been paid. Further details on the enforcement actions  taken in 2014 are presented in section&nbsp;4.2.5.</p>  <h3>Reported events</h3>  <p>Reported events have been ranked using the International  Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES). INES is a tool originally introduced by the International Atomic  Energy Agency to classify events at nuclear power plants. Since 2006, the use of  the scale has been extended to include other radiological events. Further  details on the use of the scale are presented in section&nbsp;3.1.</p>  <p>There were 147 events reported to  the CNSC related to nuclear substances involving the licensees covered in this  report – all of which were assessed by CNSC staff. Of these, 141 were ranked as INES Level 0 (no safety significance) and five  were ranked as Level 1 (anomaly) due to the amount of nuclear substances  involved and the type of event reported (loss of nuclear substances). The remaining  event – ranked as Level&nbsp;2 (incident) – resulted in 10&nbsp;persons receiving  radiation doses above the public dose limit of 1&nbsp;mSv. The event occurred  in an industrial setting and was a result of the workers being inadvertently  present in the proximity of two fixed nuclear gauges mistakenly left in the  open position with the source exposed. None of the individuals was a NEW. The  highest dose received by any individual in this event was 10.5 mSv (which  amounts to approximately 20% of the annual dose limit for NEWs). There  were no releases of nuclear substances into the environment above regulatory  limits. No other members of the public were exposed to radiation in this  incident.</p>  <p>For all of the events reported, licensees implemented  appropriate response measures to mitigate the impacts of the events and to  limit radiation exposure to workers and the public. These measures were  reviewed by CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory.</p>  <div class="module-table-contents">

</ul>  </div>  <h2 id="sec-1">1 Background</h2>  <h3>CNSC mission</h3>  <p>The mission of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission  (CNSC) is to regulate the use of  nuclear energy and materials to protect health, safety, security and the  environment, and to implement Canada's international commitments on the  peaceful use of nuclear energy; and to disseminate objective scientific,  technical and regulatory information to the public.</p>  <p>For a comprehensive overview of the CNSC and its  activities, readers are invited to consult the CNSC's <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/reports/annual-reports/">annual  report</a>.</p>  <h3>Regulatory oversight</h3>  <ul>
<li>The CNSC regulates the nuclear industry in Canada  through a comprehensive program of licensing, certification, compliance verification  and enforcement. For each nuclear industry sector described in this report (medical,  industrial, academic and research, and commercial), CNSC staff conduct  inspections, assessments and reviews to evaluate each licensee's programs,  processes and safety performance. The safe use of nuclear substances in Canada is  a reflection of licensees' compliance with the <a href="http://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.3/index.html"><em>Nuclear Safety and Control Act</em></a> (NSCA)  as well as its associated regulations and specific conditions set out in CNSC  licences. The NSCA, its regulations and the licences, require that licensees  implement and maintain appropriate programs to ensure the safety of nuclear  activities, minimize doses to workers and the public, and minimize consequences  of events. </li>  </ul>  <h3>Regulatory process</h3>  <p>The CNSC uses a risk-informed regulatory approach, applying  resources and regulatory oversight commensurate with the risk associated with  the regulated activity. The CNSC's regulatory effort, from a licensing and  compliance perspective, is derived from this risk-informed approach.</p>  <p>For the activities covered in  this report, the CNSC's risk-informed regulatory program is applied in the  following way:</p>  <ul>
<li>Each licensed activity is assigned a weighting  factor – a coefficient assigned to represent the activity's relative significance  with respect to risk.
<ul>
<li>Factors considered in weighting include the form  of the nuclear substances (sealed source, unsealed source or radiation device),  where the material is being used (work site or controlled facility), and the compliance  history of licensees conducting their licensed activities. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, all licensees are then inspected at a  predetermined frequency of five&nbsp;years or less, based on their risk ranking.</li>  </ul>  <p>The risk-informed regulatory program provides:</p>  <ul>
<li>a risk ranking that recognizes the potential safety  impact of the licensed activity</li>
<li>effective and informed allocation of regulatory  oversight effort according to the risk ranking by licensed activity and the licensee  performance history</li>
<li>effective, transparent, consistent and  comprehensive regulatory oversight </li>  </ul>  <h3>Licensing process</h3>  <p>The possession,  use, transfer, import, export, abandonment and storage of nuclear substances  must be licensed by the CNSC when the amount of nuclear substance involved is  greater than its exemption quantity (under subsection 30(3) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2000-207/page-1.html"><em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices  Regulations</em></a>). In addition, facilities  containing certain types of <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/page-1.html#h-1">Class  II prescribed equipment</a>, such as particle accelerators, must also be  licensed prior to the construction, operation or decommissioning of such a  facility. A licence is also required to service radiation devices that contain  nuclear substances, as well as Class II prescribed equipment.</p>  <p>To obtain a licence, an applicant must submit an application  to the CNSC. The CNSC will issue a licence only when the applicant:</p>  <ul>
<li>is deemed qualified to carry on the activity  that the licence will authorize</li>
<li>has demonstrated that it will protect the health  and safety of persons and the environment</li>
<li>has demonstrated that it will maintain national  security</li>
<li>has confirmed that it will adhere to  international obligations to which Canada has agreed</li>  </ul>  <p>The licensing process includes a thorough technical  assessment by CNSC staff of applications submitted to the CNSC. All licence  applications are assessed based on the risk ranking of proposed licensed activities.</p>  <p>To ensure that the CNSC's expectations for licence  applications are clear and to facilitate proponents' interactions with the  regulator, the CNSC has produced a series of licence application guides that outline  application expectations. Available from the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/">CNSC website</a>, these guides are  reviewed regularly to ensure that they provide useful guidance to the regulated  community, thus facilitating CNSC licensing reviews and minimizing regulatory  burden. </p>  <p>Existing licensees follow the same process as new applicants  when applying for licence renewals. The CNSC decision to renew a licence is  based on the application information submitted as well as a satisfactory  compliance performance history. This includes a review of compliance  information such as inspection results, reported incidents and events, and annual  compliance reports.</p>  <p>If the application satisfies the above requirements, the Commission,  or a designated officer authorized by the Commission, may issue a licence  authorizing the licensee to conduct the activities requested in the application.  The licence includes provisions that define and limit the scope of the  authorized activities, as well as specific conditions that must be fulfilled by  the licensee when conducting those activities. </p>  <h3>Certification of prescribed equipment</h3>  <p>All radiation devices and prescribed equipment, including  certain types of transport packages, must be certified by the CNSC before they can  be used in Canada.</p>  <p>An application for certification must be submitted to the CNSC  in order for a certificate to be issued. Upon receipt, CNSC staff conduct a  thorough technical review of the information contained in the submission to  determine if:</p>  <ul>
<li>the radiation device or prescribed equipment  meets all CNSC regulatory requirements and is safe to use</li>
<li>adequate measures are in place in respect of  their use in order to protect the environment, national security, and the  health and safety and security of persons</li>  </ul>  <p>If satisfied that the design meets the above requirements,  the Commission, or a designated officer authorized by the Commission, may issue  a certificate for the prescribed equipment or radiation device. </p>  <p>CNSC regulatory documents <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/rdgd352/">RD/GD-352,<em> Design, Testing and Performance of Exposure  Devices</em></a>and <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/gd254/">RD/GD-254, <em>Licence Application Guide: Certification  of Radiation Devices or Class II Prescribed Equipment</em></a><em> outline CNSC  expectations for the certification of prescribed equipment.</em></p>  <h3>Certification of Class II radiation safety officers</h3>  <p>All licensees that operate Class II nuclear facilities or that  service Class II prescribed equipment must have a certified radiation safety  officer (RSO) and also designate a qualified temporary replacement. The person  occupying the position of RSO has the responsibility to ensure that licensed  activities are conducted safely and all regulatory expectations are met.<br />  There are two components to the certification process: </p>  <ul>
<li>assessment of the candidate&rsquo;s qualifications to  perform the duties of the position, based on the submitted application </li>
<li>assessment of the candidate&rsquo;s knowledge, based  on an examination </li>  </ul>  <p>If the candidate is able to clearly demonstrate to the CNSC their  knowledge, as it relates to the RSO position within their organization, the Commission  or a designated officer authorized by the Commission will certify the candidate  in the position of RSO.</p>  <p>The process for certification of Class II RSOs, along with  guidance for applicants, is outlined in <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc2-2-3/">REGDOC-2.2.3,<em> Personnel Certification: Radiation Safety  Officers for Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment</em></a>. </p>  <h3>Licensing and certification decisions</h3>  <p>In 2014, designated officers in the CNSC Directorate of  Nuclear Substance Regulation made a total of 2,273 licensing and certification  decisions. As shown in Table  1,  the majority of these were licensing decisions.</p>  <table class="table table-bordered">

Regular inspections  and desktop evaluations verify that licensees comply with the NSCA and regulations,  as well as the conditions of their licences.</p>  <p>The CNSC verifies  compliance by conducting site inspections and by reviewing licensee documentation  and operational activities. Licensees are required to report routine  performance data, through annual compliance reports, and unusual occurrences.  In addition, the CNSC conducts investigations of unplanned events or accidents  involving nuclear substances. </p>  <p>The CNSC uses a graded approach to enforcement to encourage compliance and  deter future non-compliances. When a non-compliance (or a continued  non-compliance) has been identified, CNSC staff assess its risk and safety  significance in order to determine the appropriate enforcement action. The  chosen enforcement action is commensurate with the risk that the  non-compliance presents to the environment, the health and safety of workers  and members of the public, and to national security. Enforcement actions may include a  variety of actions with different levels of severity, including orders and administrative monetary penalties.  Each enforcement action is a discrete and independent response to a non-compliance.</p>  <h3>Safety and control area framework</h3>  <p>To ensure comprehensive regulatory oversight and reporting,  CNSC staff have developed a set of safety and control areas (SCAs). SCAs have  been in use for a number of years, and represent a well-established set of technical  areas that have proven effective in evaluating licensee safety performance of  regulated facilities and activities under the CNSC's purview. Each SCA is subdivided  into specific areas that define its key components. The CNSC has defined 14  SCAs: </p>  <ul>
<li>management  system </li>
<li>human performance  management</li>
<li>operating  performance</li>
<li>safety analysis</li>
<li>physical  design</li>
<li>fitness for  service</li>
<li>radiation  protection</li>
<li>conventional  health and safety</li>
<li>environmental  protection</li>
<li>emergency  management and fire protection</li>
<li>waste management</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>safeguards  and non-proliferation</li>
<li>packaging  and transport</li>  </ul>  <p>For the purpose of this report, safety performance in the  four nuclear sectors is measured by examining the licensees' regulatory  compliance in three selected SCAs: operating  performance, radiation protection and security. This report also considers doses  to workers and reported events. Because of their greater complexity, the two  high-energy research particle accelerator facilities are subject to more frequent and more detailed CNSC compliance  verification&nbsp;activities than other licensees covered in this report.  Consequently, the safety performance for these two facilities is  measured against all of the 14 SCAs using an approach consistent with reporting for  other major CNSC-regulated facilities in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="sec-2">2 Introduction</h2>  <p>his annual regulatory oversight report focuses on the  results of compliance verification and enforcement activities for licensees that  use nuclear substances and prescribed equipment in four nuclear sectors: </p>  <ul>
<li>medical</li>
<li>industrial</li>
<li>academic and research </li>
<li>commercial</li>  </ul>  <p>It also includes Canada's two high-energy research particle accelerator  facilities: TRIUMF Accelerators Inc., located in Vancouver, BC, and Canadian  Light Source Inc., located in Saskatoon, SK. It does not cover uranium mines  and mills, waste facilities, dosimetry services or other Class I nuclear facilities  such as nuclear power plants and nuclear research reactors. This annual regulatory  oversight report provides regulatory information for the 2014 calendar year.</p>
<h3 id="sec-2.1">2.1 Compliance programs</h3>  <p>CNSC staff establish compliance verification plans for each nuclear  sector, based on risk-informed regulatory oversight of the activities of the  sectors, to determine appropriate levels of regulatory monitoring and control.  Modifications to the compliance plans are made on an ongoing basis in response  to events and changes in licensee performance.</p>  <p>In 2014, CNSC staff  conducted 1,453 inspections across the four nuclear sectors (medical, industrial,  academic and research, and commercial) and two high-energy research particle  accelerator facilities. Each inspection resulted in one inspection report per  licensed activity inspected during the visit. Each inspection report provided  an overall rating for each applicable safety and control area; these are  included in this report. The CNSC utilized a risk-informed decision process for  planning and conducting compliance activities, commensurate with the risk  associated with the various uses of nuclear substances within those sectors and  facilities. CNSC staff also verified compliance through desktop reviews of  licensee annual compliance reports, licence applications and licensee program  documents.</p>
<h2 id="sec-3">3 Overview</h2>  <h3 id="sec-3.1">3.1 What&rsquo;s new in this report</h3>  <ul>
<li>Security  inspection ratings
<ul>
<li>The results of the inspection rating  for the security safety and control area (SCA) have been included in this  report. These ratings can be found in section 4.2.4. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reported events
<ul>
<li>
<p>Details of events reported by licensees are  presented at the overall level rather than by sector, with the exception of  those related to high-energy research particle accelerator facilities. Reported  events are found in section 4.2.6 of this report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reported  events have been ranked using the International  Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES), a tool for communicating the  safety significance of nuclear and radiological events to the public. This tool  allows the establishment of a proper perspective of an event's safety  significance. <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/ines.pdf">Additional information on the INES tool</a> can be found on the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.</p>
<p>The scale has been used to classify events at nuclear power plants  since 1990 and has been extended over the years to apply to all nuclear  industry installations. By 2006, it had been adapted to all events associated  with the transport, storage and use of radioactive sources and nuclear  substances. Note that the scale is not a tool to compare safety performances among  facilities or organizations, but to effectively communicate the safety  significance of events. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the  purposes of this report, the scale  was applied to all events associated with the transport, storage and use of  radioactive sources and nuclear substances reported by licensees within the  four nuclear sectors covered under this report. The scale was also used to rate  events that resulted in exposures to workers and members of the public as a  result of events. Section 4.2.6 provides details on  the events reported by licensees in 2014.</p>
<p>To validate the CNSC's use of the scale for nuclear substance-related  events, CNSC staff reviewed historical data in the IAEA INES database. This  data is included in <a href="#sec-a">Appendix A</a> for reference. The review confirmed that the  CNSC's ranking and number of nuclear substance-related events is on par with  other countries. </p>

<p>Just like information on earthquakes or temperature would be difficult to understand without the Richter or Celsius scales, the INES Scale explains the significance of events from a range of activities, including industrial and medical use of radiation sources, operations at nuclear facilities and transport of radioactive material.</p>
<p>Events are classified on the scale at seven levels: Levels 1–3 are called &quot;incidents&quot; and Levels 4–7 &quot;accidents&quot;. The scale is designed so that the severity of an event is about ten times greater for each increase in level on the scale. Events without safety  significance are called &quot; deviations&quot; and are classified Below Scale / Level 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 7: Major accident</li>
<li>Level 6: Serius accident</li>
<li>Level 5: Accident with wider consequences</li>
<li>Level 4: Accident with local consequences</li>
<li>Level 3: Serius incident</li>
<li>Level 2: Incident</li>
<li>Level 1: Anomaly</li>
</ul>

<p>Disused, spent and orphaned sources are a  growing concern for nuclear regulators worldwide. In Canada, there were some  events reported to the CNSC in 2014 that underlined the importance of  implementing a national strategy for addressing this issue. The events and details  of the steps taken to address this issue are presented in section 4.2.6 of this report.</p>

<h3 id="sec-3.2">3.2 Sectors</h3>  <h4>3.2.1 Medical</h4>  <p>Licensees  in the medical sector use nuclear substances and operate accelerators and  other equipment for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in hospitals and  medical clinics. Medical applications using radiopharmaceuticals are designed  to target specific tissues and organs, allowing for the delivery of nuclear  substances to specific areas of the body for diagnostic testing or treatment. </p>  <p>Diagnostic nuclear medicine studies assist in the diagnosis of  medical conditions based on the physiological functions of organs, tissues or  bones. Radiopharmaceuticals containing nuclear substances such as technetium-99m,  gallium-67 and fluorine-18 are administered to patients for imaging purposes. Examples  of common nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures include myocardial perfusion  scans (to visualize heart function and blood flow), bone scans (to evaluate  bone metabolism, infection or tumours) and renal scans (to evaluate kidney  function). </p>  <p>Radioisotopes are also used in many therapeutic procedures.  For example, iodine-131 is used to treat diseases of the thyroid gland, while  other isotopes such as yttrium-90 may be used in conjunction with antibodies  for site-specific treatment of certain cancers.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">
<figcaption>Figure 4: Linear accelerator used in cancer treatment</figcaption>
<img src="/images/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2014/figure_4.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /> </figure>  <p>Medical  linear accelerators (as shown in Figure 4)  and teletherapy and brachytherapy equipment  are also used for therapeutic procedures. These devices are used to treat  cancer by delivering carefully controlled doses of radiation to cancerous  tissue.</p>  <p>Veterinary nuclear medicine uses techniques similar to those  employed in human nuclear medicine. Veterinary clinics across the country offer  a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures and, in  some cases, radiation therapy treatment using medical accelerators or  teletherapy.</p>  <p>The results of CNSC staff evaluation of the regulatory  performance of all medical sector licensees inspected in 2014 are included in  the overall results. The following three subsectors are highlighted in further  detail: diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine, radiation therapy and  veterinary nuclear medicine.</p>  <h4>3.2.2 Industrial</h4>  <p>Licensees  in the industrial sector use nuclear substances either in industrial facilities  or as part of fieldwork or construction. Typical applications include the  measurement of physical parameters such as density, moisture content and geological  composition in civil engineering. They are also used for material examination  in civil engineering, and level and flow rate in industrial facilities (such as  oil and gas exploration, mining and manufacturing). These nuclear substances  are found in radiation devices such as fixed nuclear gauges, as shown in Figure  5, which monitor production processes in many industries, and portable nuclear  gauges, as shown in Figure 6. </p>  <p>Portable  gauges are often used to measure moisture and density in soil, and the  compaction of asphalt in road construction. In industrial radiography, nuclear  substances are used in exposure devices for the non-destructive examination of  materials. Persons operating an exposure device, or supervising a trainee in  the operation of such device, must be certified by the CNSC. Exposure devices used  for industrial radiography are engineered and operated using multiple safety  barriers to reduce the potential for accidental occupational exposure. One  example is dense material, such as depleted uranium, which shields people  against the intense radioactivity of the source contained inside the device. </p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">
<figcaption>Figure 5: Mounted fixed nuclear gauge</figcaption>
<img src="/images/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2014/figure_5.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /> </figure>  <p>Industrial applications of nuclear substances are as varied  as the processes to which they are applied. Specific radioisotopes are chosen  based on the type of radiation they emit, the intensity of their radiation and  the intended application. For example, the nuclear substance chosen for  industrial radiography depends on the size and density of the material to be  imaged. Cobalt-60, with its high-energy gamma radiation, is used for large structures  and dense materials such as structural concrete. When the material does not  require the penetrating power of cobalt-60, other nuclear substances, such as  iridium-192 or selenium-75, are used instead. Cesium-137, another gamma  emitter, is most commonly used in portable and fixed gauges to measure density.  In other industrial uses, such as measuring moisture content, portable gauges  most commonly use neutron-emitting nuclear substances such as  americium-241/beryllium.</p>  <p>The results of CNSC staff evaluation of the regulatory  performance of all industrial sector licensees inspected in 2014 are included  in the overall results. The following four subsectors are highlighted in  further detail: industrial radiography, oil well logging, portable gauge and fixed  gauge.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

The following four subsectors are highlighted in  further detail: industrial radiography, oil well logging, portable gauge and fixed  gauge.</p>  <h4>3.2.3 Academic and research </h4>  <p>Licensed  activities in the academic and research sector are conducted in universities,  colleges and research laboratories, and focus mainly on biological and  biomedical research that primarily uses open (unsealed) nuclear substances, as  shown in Figure  7.  This sector also uses sealed sources, radiation devices and accelerators for  teaching, and for pure and applied research, as well as irradiators to  irradiate cells or samples in laboratories. </p>  <p>The results of CNSC staff evaluation of the  regulatory performance of all academic and research sector licensees inspected  in 2014 are included in the overall results. The laboratory studies  and consolidated uses of nuclear substances subsector is highlighted in further  detail below.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

<img src="/images/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2014/figure_7.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /> </figure>  <h5>CNSC laboratory</h5>  <p>As part of its regulatory functions, the CNSC conducts  certain activities regulated under the <em>Nuclear  Safety and Control Act</em> (NSCA). To ensure oversight transparency, CNSC  management has organizationally separated its role as a licensee (which resides  within the Technical Support Branch) from its role as a regulator (under the  responsibility of the Regulatory Operations Branch). </p>  <p>The laboratory provides calibration services and analytical  services for both groups of CNSC staff, including CNSC inspectors. To provide  these services, the CNSC holds two licences: one for its gamma calibration irradiator,  located at its laboratory in Ottawa, and a second for consolidated uses of  nuclear substances that covers all other activities conducted by the CNSC at  its laboratory or elsewhere in Canada. Both licences were issued in accordance  with the NSCA and are regulated  using the same licensing and compliance verification processes that would apply  to other, similar licensees. </p>  <p>Under analytical  services, the laboratory analyzes samples that are taken for the Independent  Environmental Monitoring Program, as well as those taken during CNSC inspections.  The CNSC laboratory also participates in the Nuclear Forensic Capability Development  Project under the Canadian Safety and&nbsp;Security Program. The CNSC  laboratory provides the calibration services for all radiation instrumentation  used by CNSC staff, including inspectors at nuclear power plants and those in CNSC  regional offices.</p>  <p>Both the  sample analysis and the radiation instrumentation calibration services require  the use of radioactive substances and devices. The laboratory has an inventory  of sealed sources that are used at the lab and are loaned out to internal  permit holders. The inventory of sealed sources is quite large; over 500 sealed  sources are stored at the laboratory.  </p>  <p>There are  two internal permit holders under the consolidated uses licence: the laboratory  itself, and the CNSC's Emergency Management Programs Division, which borrows  sources for training for radiological emergencies for first responders within  Canada. </p>  <p>The CNSC laboratory is responsible for the safe conduct of  activities under both licences. In this report, the CNSC laboratory is included  in the laboratory studies and  consolidated use of nuclear substances subsector. Its specific performance  results are provided to ensure that the CNSC, as both regulator and licensee, is  reporting on its licensed activities in a transparent manner.</p>  <h4>3.2.4 Commercial</h4>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

<img src="/images/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2014/figure_8.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /> </figure>  <p>The commercial sector encompasses a number of licensed  activities related to the production, processing, storage and distribution of  nuclear substances, the calibration of radiation detection instruments, as well  as the servicing of radiation devices and Class II prescribed equipment for  commercial purposes. Figure  8  shows the internal components of a partially assembled cyclotron used for the production  of radioisotopes. </p>  <p>Nuclear  substances are also found in devices that are commonly used by Canadians, such  as smoke detectors. Such devices may not require a licence for their possession  by the end user; however, their manufacture and initial distribution in Canada  are licensed by the CNSC. </p>  <p>The results of CNSC staff evaluation of the regulatory  performance of all commercial sector licensees inspected in 2014 are included  in the overall results. The following five subsectors are highlighted in  further detail: operation of isotope production accelerators, processing of  nuclear substances, distribution of nuclear substances, servicing of radiation  devices and prescribed equipment, and calibration of radiation devices and  prescribed equipment.</p>  <h4>3.2.5	High-energy research particle accelerator facilities </h4>  <p>There are two major high-energy research particle  accelerator facilities operating under CNSC licences in Canada: TRIUMF  Accelerators Inc. (TRIUMF) and Canadian Light Source Inc. (CLS).</p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

<img src="/images/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2014/figure_9.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" /> </figure>  <p>TRIUMF, located on the University of British Columbia  campus, is Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics  research and related sciences. TRIUMF is also a major producer of radioisotopes  used for medical diagnostic procedures. It is owned and operated as a joint  venture by a consortium of 18 Canadian universities. TRIUMF operates one 520  mega-electron volt (MeV) cyclotron accelerator facility, shown in Figure 9, four smaller cyclotrons facilities, and three linear  accelerator facilities. The main cyclotron has been in operation for more than 40  years.</p>  <p>CLS  operates a synchrotron facility, shown in  Figure 10, on  the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon. The facility consists of  three major accelerator systems: a 300&nbsp;MeV linear accelerator, a booster  ring that accelerates electrons up to 2.9&nbsp;giga-electron volts (GeV) and a  storage ring that keeps electrons circulating at 2.9&nbsp;GeV for several  hours. The facility produces synchrotron radiation that is used as a light  source for experiments in diverse fields such as biology, materials research,  atomic and molecular science, earth sciences, pharmaceuticals, biomedical  research and electronics. Synchrotron radiation is electromagnetic radiation  produced by magnetic bending of high-energy electrons in a storage ring by  different devices (magnets, wigglers and undulators). The light ranges from  infrared through the visible spectrum to ultraviolet and X-rays. The  experiments take place in optical beam lines tangential to the storage ring.  The facility has been in operation since 2005</p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

Both facilities have licence conditions handbooks and are  subject to more frequent and more detailed compliance verification&nbsp;activities  than other licensees covered in this report.&nbsp;Consequently, the compliance  performance for these two facilities is addressed in a separate section.&nbsp;This  approach is consistent with reporting for other major CNSC-regulated facilities  in Canada, such as those on <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/reports/report-on-uranium-and-nuclear-processing-facilities">uranium and nuclear processing facilities</a>.</p>  <h4>3.2.6	Number of licences by sector</h4>  <p>There was an overall reduction in the  number of licences in all sectors. Compared to the year 2010, there has been a 7.9%  decrease in the total number of licences in 2014. This decrease is largely  attributable to the considerable effort that CNSC staff have expended on  consolidating licences, i.e., wherever feasible, replacing multiple licences  held by a single licensee by a single site licence. Other contributing factors  are the amalgamation of regional healthcare authorities and the acquisition of  small companies by larger ones. </p>  <figure class="col-md-12 pull-right well">

Regulatory performance results for these low-energy  accelerators are included in the industrial and medical sectors of this report. </p>  <p>The  distribution of licences among the four sectors has remained essentially  unchanged since 2010.

The term nuclear energy worker (NEW) means a person who  is required, in the course of his or her business or occupation in connection  with a nuclear substance or nuclear facility, to perform duties in circumstances  that may result in receiving a dose of radiation greater than 1 millisievert (mSv)  per year, which is the limit for members of the public. &quot;Other worker&quot; means a  person who is unlikely to receive an annual dose greater than 1 mSv per year while  performing duties in connection with a nuclear substance or nuclear facility. This  report provides dose information for both types of workers, while primarily  focusing on NEWs. </p>  <h4>3.3.1 Nuclear energy workers by the numbers</h4>  <p>A  total of 60,407 workers in the four nuclear sectors and the two major facilities  covered in this report were monitored in 2014.

<h3 id="sec-3.4">3.4 Occupational doses</h3>  <h4>3.4.1 Doses in perspective</h4>  <p>Non-occupational exposure to radiation can occur in many  situations. For example, a person may be exposed to radiation during an  airplane flight or by undergoing a medical procedure such as a chest X-ray. Natural  background radiation contributes to radiation exposure received by all persons  living on earth. The average annual dose  from natural background radiation is approximately 1.8 mSv in Canada and 2.4  mSv worldwide. Among major Canadian cities, Winnipeg has the highest annual  average dose from <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/fact-sheets/natural-background-radiation">background radiation</a> at 4.1 mSv. </p>  <p>Figure  13  provides some perspective on these situations as they relate to occupational radiation  exposures received by workers and the public as a result of nuclear activities  licensed by the CNSC.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

</table>  </details>  </figure>  <div class="clear"></div>  <h4>3.4.2 Dose limits</h4>  <p>The CNSC's regulatory <a href="http://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-203/page-4.html">effective  dose limits</a> for NEWs are set at 50 mSv in any one-year dosimetry period and  a total of 100&nbsp;mSv over a five-year dosimetry period. The one-year  dosimetry period covers January 1 to December 31 of every year. The current  five-year dosimetry period started on January 1, 2011 and will end on December  31, 2015. For a person who is not a NEW, the effective dose limit is 1 mSv per  calendar year. In this report,  effective dose refers to the dose received by the whole body. For  activities where there is a need for direct handling of nuclear substances,  doses to the hands are also monitored. These are known as extremity doses, and they  are subject to a regulatory dose limit of 500 mSv in any one-year dosimetry  period for NEWs and 50 mSv per calendar year for other workers. The concept of  a five-year dosimetry period is not applied to extremity doses or to the  effective doses incurred by persons who are not NEWs.</p>  <p>For this report, workers who are not NEWs are referred to as  &quot;other workers&quot; and are subject to the regulatory dose limit of 1 mSv per year  – the same as for members of the public.</p>  <h4>3.4.3 Ascertaining effective dose </h4>  <p>Each licensee is required to  ascertain the effective dose received by each worker engaged in activities authorized  under their CNSC licence. Doses may be ascertained by direct measurement (through  monitoring) or by estimation, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-203/page-1.html"><em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em></a><em>.</em> The <em>Radiation Protection Regulations </em>also stipulate that the licensee  must use a licensed dosimetry service for monitoring every NEW who has a  reasonable probability of receiving an effective dose of greater than 5 mSv per  year. However, regardless of the potential for occupational exposure, licensees  conducting licensed activities in certain industries, such as industrial  radiography, are always required to use a licensed dosimetry service provider  to ascertain doses for the NEWs they employ (under subsection 30(3) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2000-207/page-1.html"><em>Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices  Regulations</em></a>).</p>  <h4>3.4.4 When a dose limit is exceeded</h4>  <p>In a situation where a worker may have exceeded a regulatory  dose limit, licensees are required to remove the worker from any activities  that may add to his or her dose, investigate the cause of the exposure, take  action to prevent a recurrence, and report to the CNSC. CNSC staff review the information  provided by the licensee following each investigation. Depending on the  circumstances, the Commission, or in most cases a designated officer authorized  by the Commission, may authorize the worker to return to work according to the process  defined in the <em>Radiation Protection  Regulations.</em>The return-to-work  authorization may specify conditions and prorated dose limits for the remainder  of the dosimetry period.</p>  <h3 id="sec-3.5">3.5 Safety performance measures</h3>  <p>This report provides information on doses to workers,  inspection compliance ratings, enforcement actions and reported events as  safety performance measures. CNSC staff review licensee documents and conduct  field inspections to verify that licensees have implemented effective safety  programs and practices. Results of these inspections provide information on key  aspects of safety performance, within each safety and control area (SCA) relevant  to the licensed activity. For the purpose of this report, the following three  SCAs are the most relevant indicators of safety performance for licensees in  the four nuclear sectors covered in this report: operating performance, radiation  protection and security. The report provides the compliance ratings (also  referred to as inspection ratings), which reflect overall licensee performance  at a program level for each of these SCAs. The nature, type and safety significance  of events reported by licensees, and the nature and type of enforcement actions  taken by the CNSC in 2014 are provided as supplementary indicators of safety  performance. Each performance measure is described below.</p>  <p>Note that licensee performance for the two high-energy research  particle accelerators are reported against each of the 14 SCAs, similar to other major  CNSC-regulated facilities in Canada, and can be found in section 9 of this report.</p>  <h4>3.5.1 Operating performance</h4>  <p>Operating performance refers to the licensee's ability to  perform licensed activities in accordance with pertinent operational and safety  requirements defined in the <em>Nuclear  Safety and Control Act </em>(NSCA), its associated regulations and licence  conditions. Licensees are expected to demonstrate that they comply with operational  and safety requirements by providing workers with appropriate procedures for the  safe use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment, by ensuring that  workers follow procedures, and by maintaining records that demonstrate  compliance. Operating performance is also referred to as &quot;Operational  Procedures&quot; in the inspection reports provided to licensees. Appendix B   shows the links between the naming convention in the inspection reports and  those presented in this report for safety and control areas.</p>  <h4>3.5.2 Radiation protection</h4>  <p>Radiation protection programs are required for every  licensee to ensure that contamination levels and radiation doses received by  individuals are monitored, controlled and maintained below regulatory dose  limits, and kept at levels that are <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/pubs_catalogue/uploads/G129rev1_e.pdf">as  low as reasonably achievable</a> (ALARA), social and economic factors being  taken into account. Licensees can meet these objectives by monitoring worker  doses; posting radiation warning signs; planning appropriately for radiological  emergencies; managing oversight of operational activities; instituting  effective workplace practices that emphasize the use of time, distance and  shielding to minimize exposure to radiation; and using appropriate protective  equipment.</p>  <h4>3.5.3 Doses to workers</h4>  <p>All licensees are required to implement a radiation  protection program that ensures that the radiation doses to workers are well  below regulatory limit and kept ALARA, social and economic factors being taken  into account. Thus, ascertainment of the magnitude of doses received by its  personnel is an integral part of a licensee's radiation protection program. The  dose data discussed in this report was extracted from licensees' mandatory annual  compliance reports. Since 2013, data from all such reports has been included in  this report. In previous years' reports (2008 to 2012), the doses reported were  based on only a representative sample of annual compliance reports within each  sector. </p>  <h4>3.5.4 Security</h4>  <p>The security SCA covers the physical security measures, practices  and programs that licensees are required to have in place to prevent the loss or  illegal use, possession or removal of nuclear substances during their entire  lifecycle, including while they are in storage or during transport. The extent  of the security measures required depends upon the types of nuclear substances  used and activities performed by each licensee<em>.</em></p>  <h4>3.5.5 Enforcement actions</h4>  <p>The CNSC may take  a variety of compliance enforcement actions to ensure that licensees correct non-compliances  in an effective and timely manner. The type of enforcement action taken is  commensurate with the risk the non-compliance presents to the environment, the  health and safety of workers and the public, and to national security. This report provides information on the  following types of enforcement actions taken by the CNSC: orders, administrative  monetary penalties, decertification of certified exposure device operators, and  decertification of radiation safety officers at Class II nuclear facilities. </p>  <h4>3.5.6 Reported events</h4>  <p>Licensees are required, under the NSCA and its associated  regulations, to immediately report to the CNSC specific types of events related  to their licensed activities. Within 21&nbsp;days of the initial report,  licensees are required to submit a final report to the CNSC on the event. The  final report must include an analysis of the cause and circumstances of the  event, as well as the measures taken, or proposed to be taken by the licensee  to prevent recurrence. Together, the initial and final reports allow the CNSC  to verify whether the licensee has taken appropriate measures to mitigate the  event, and implemented adequate corrective actions to prevent recurrence. </p>  <h3 id="sec-3.6">3.6 Data collection</h3>  <p>Dose data discussed in this report was extracted from annual  compliance reports submitted by licensees in calendar year 2014. Such data is an  indicator of the occupational doses incurred by all persons engaged in licensed  activities in the four sectors and two major facilities covered in this report.  Compliance ratings and non-compliance data, including CNSC enforcement actions,  was obtained from the CNSC's compliance  verification and enforcement program. Safety performance data from 2010  to 2013 is also included to identify five-year trends. </p>  <h2 id="sec-4">4 Use of nuclear substances: safety performance</h2>  <h3 id="sec-4.1">4.1 Overall safety performance (all sectors)</h3>  <p>In 2014, CNSC staff  exercised ongoing regulatory oversight of approximately 1,700 licensees,  holding a total of 2,415 licences in respect of the four nuclear sectors (medical,  industrial, academic and research, and commercial) covered in this report.  As part of this work, CNSC staff conducted compliance verification activities  consisting of field inspections, desktop reviews of licensee annual compliance  reports and other documentation, and technical assessments of licensee  activities. Staff concluded that the use of nuclear substances in Canada is  safe. The evaluations of findings for the safety and control areas (SCAs)  covered in this report show that, overall, licensees made adequate provisions  for the protection of the health, safety and security of persons and the protection  of the environment from the use of nuclear substances, and took the measures  required to implement Canada's international obligations.</p>  <p>Doses to workers  remained very low in 2014 and followed a constant trend when compared with previous  years. Overall, more than 99.9% of all workers – including both nuclear energy  workers (NEWs) and other workers – received doses below their applicable regulatory  dose limits. No NEWs exceeded the one- or five-year<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> dose limits of 50 millisieverts (mSv) and 100 mSv, respectively.</p>  <p>There were two separate  situations where, based on dosimetry results, workers (who were not NEWs)  exceeded the annual regulatory dose limit of 1 mSv. In both situations,  licensees responded in accordance with the <em>Radiation  Protection Regulations.</em> Workers did not experience immediate health  consequences, nor are they expected to suffer long-term health consequences in  either situation. More details are provided in section  4.2.1 .</p>  <p>CNSC staff  conducted 1,453 inspections in 2014 to verify compliance with CNSC regulatory  requirements. </p>  <ul>
<li>All four nuclear sectors continued to demonstrate  good performance within the operating performance SCA, with 88.4% of inspected  licensees found to be in compliance. For licensees that failed to meet  regulatory requirements, 11.5% were given &quot;below expectations&quot; ratings and 0.1%  (or one inspection) received &quot;unacceptable&quot; ratings. The inspection with the &quot;unacceptable&quot;  rating resulted in the inspector issuing an order to the licensee to ensure  corrective actions were taken immediately. Inspectors may also issue orders to  licensees to take immediate corrective action in cases of &quot;below expectations&quot;  ratings or following CNSC investigations of reported events, in order to  protect the workers, the public and the environment. </li>
<li>Similarly, all four nuclear sectors continued to  demonstrate good performance within the radiation protection SCA, with 89.1% of  inspected licensees found to be in compliance. For licensees that failed to  meet regulatory requirements, 10.7% were given &quot;below expectations&quot; ratings and  0.2% (or 3 inspections) were given &quot;unacceptable&quot; ratings. Those inspections  with &quot;unacceptable&quot; ratings resulted in the inspectors issuing orders to  licensees to ensure corrective actions were taken immediately.</li>
<li>Results of compliance verification related to security (SCA-Security) are included in this report. Adequate security provisions were in place for 94.8% of inspected licensees. The remaining 5.2% of licensees obtained “below expectations” ratings.</li>  </ul>  <p>CNSC staff  required licensees that failed to meet regulatory requirements to take corrective  measures to address non-compliances found during inspections. All  non-compliances are systematically tracked by CNSC staff until licensees take appropriate  corrective measures to address them to the satisfaction of the CNSC. Corrective  measures put in place by licensees in 2014 were reviewed by CNSC staff and  found to be satisfactory. </p>  <p>Compliance with  the mandatory tracking of high-risk sealed sources was fully satisfactory in  2014. All of the 148 inspected licensees were found to be compliant with this requirement.  Further information on this topic is available in the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/reports/ssts/"><em>National  Sealed Source Registry and Sealed Source Tracking System Annual Report</em></a><em>.</em></p>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC escalated  compliance enforcement actions against 19 licensees in the four  sectors covered in this report. A total of 12 orders were issued, of which 11  were issued by inspectors and one by a designated officer. All licensees  complied with the terms and conditions of the orders and implemented corrective  measures that were satisfactory to CNSC staff. Seven administrative  monetary penalties (AMPs) were also issued by designated officers. Three of these AMPs were reviewed by the Commission following a  request for such review by the person named in the administrative penalty. All seven  AMPs were paid. Section 4.2.5 provides additional information on the CNSC's enforcement  actions.</p>  <p>For a second  consecutive year, no exposure device operators or radiation  safety officers at Class II nuclear facilities were decertified.</p>  <p>In  2014, licensees reported a total of 147 events to the CNSC involving nuclear  substances. Of these, 141 were categorized by CNSC staff as  Level 0 (no safety significance) according to the International Nuclear and  Radiological Event Scale (INES), used for rating events involving nuclear  substances. Five events were ranked as Level 1 (anomaly) due to the amount of  nuclear substances involved and the type of event reported (loss of nuclear  substances). One event, ranked as Level 2 (incident), is explained in further  detail in section 4.2.1 .</p>  <div>

</details>  </figure>  <p>In 2014, there were two separate instances during which workers  exceeded the applicable regulatory dose limits.</p>  <p><strong><em>Fixed gauge workers</em></strong> – In March 2014, workers at a mine site  operated by Cliffs Quebec Mine Iron Mining Limited, located in Fermont, QC, were  exposed to levels of radiation above the annual effective dose limit of 1 mSv  for members of the public. Cliffs holds a CNSC licence authorizing it to use  fixed nuclear gauges as part of the mine production process control. The  workers were in an area at the Cliffs facility where two nuclear gauges were located.  The gauges should have been locked with the source in the shielded position for  the duration of the work. However, in this instance the two gauges had their  sources in the open or unshielded position. The 24 workers, who were not NEWs, received  effective doses of radiation ranging from 0 mSv to 10.5 mSv. Ten workers exceeded  the annual effective dose limit of 1 mSv. Using the INES tool presented in  section 3.1, this event ranked as  Level 2 (incident) since the exposure of one of the workers was above 10 mSv. Such  doses are well below the regulatory dose limits for NEWs and would not be  expected to result in adverse health effects to the exposed persons.</p>  <p>CNSC staff reported this event at the August&nbsp;21, 2014  Commission public meeting (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=186&amp;yr=2014">August  20 and 21, 2014 meeting minutes</a>). Cliffs took appropriate corrective measures  to prevent recurrence of this event, which were reviewed by CNSC staff and  found to be satisfactory. The CNSC review and investigation of this event were closed  at the Commission public meeting. </p>  <p><strong><em>Diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine worker</em></strong> – A worker  at a university hospital had a dosimeter showing an effective dose of 1.5&nbsp;mSv  over a three-month period. Since the worker was not a NEW, this exceeded the  annual effective dose limit for members of the public of 1 mSv. The licensee determined  that the worker's routine activities should not have resulted in an exposure of  that magnitude, but could not explain why the incident occurred. </p>  <p>As the information submitted by the licensee was not  sufficient to confirm that the dose was non-personal, no change was made to the  individual's dose record in the <a href="http://hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/occup-travail/radiation/regist/index-eng.php">National  Dose Registry</a>. </p>  <p>Events of this nature are not reported to the Commission in its  public meetings because of the uncertainty in the dose determination and since  there is no safety significance associated with such events.</p>  <p>This event ranked as  INES Level 0 (no safety significance).</p>  <h4>4.2.2 Operating  performance</h4>  <p>In 2014, CNSC staff conducted inspections to verify licensee  compliance with regulatory requirements related to the operating performance SCA.  In general, all sectors continued to demonstrate good performance within this  SCA, with 88.4% of inspected licensees found to be in compliance with  regulatory requirements. The majority of non-compliances in this SCA included  failure to comply with regulatory requirements related to worker obligations,  retention of records, and sealed source leak testing. CNSC staff tracked the  non-compliances to ensure that all were addressed and corrected by licensees to  the satisfaction of the CNSC. The safety significance of individual non-compliances  determined the urgency and the nature of corrective or enforcement actions in  each case.</p>  <p>As shown in Figure 16, most sector ratings remained nearly constant in 2014  compared to the previous year, with the exception of the commercial sector  which saw a moderate decrease in compliance ratings. More details on the  decrease in the compliance rating in operating performance for the commercial  sector are provided in section&nbsp;8.2.2.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

</details>  </figure>  <h4>4.2.3 Radiation  protection</h4>  <p>In 2014, CNSC staff conducted inspections to verify licensee  compliance with regulatory requirements related to the radiation protection  SCA. In general, all sectors continued to demonstrate good performance within  this SCA, with 89.1% of inspected licensees found to be compliant with  regulatory requirements. The majority of non-compliances included inadequate  implementation of measures to ensure that doses are kept as low as reasonably  achievable, survey meters either not being available or not calibrated, and  containers or radiation devices not being labelled properly. CNSC staff tracked  the non-compliances to ensure that all were addressed and corrected by  licensees to the satisfaction of the CNSC. The safety significance of  individual non-compliances determined the urgency and the nature of corrective  or enforcement actions in each case.</p>  <p>The ratings for all sectors are shown in Figure 17. With  the exception of the medical sector, which showed significant improvement, all other  sectors remained constant in 2014. Improvements in compliance ratings in the  diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine and radiation therapy subsectors  are attributed to a greater understanding of regulatory requirements amongst  licensees in those sectors due to increased regulatory oversight in the form of  outreach and compliance promotion efforts by CNSC staff.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

This SCA was not reported on in  previous reports. CNSC  staff verified licensee compliance against requirements described in <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/acts-and-regulations/regulatory-documents/published/html/regdoc2-12-3/">REGDOC-2.12.3, <em>Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources</em></a>. Mandatory compliance with these  requirements came into effect May 31, 2015 for licensees with Category 1 and 2  sealed sources, and will come into effect May 31, 2018 for licensees with  Category 3, 4 or 5 sealed sources. More information about <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/nuclear-substances/licensing-nuclear-substances-and-radiation-devices/sealed-source-tracking#a6">categories  of sealed sources</a> is available on the CNSC website.</p>  <p>Table  3  summarizes the performance of the four sectors with the requirements  encompassed by this SCA. Overall, all sectors showed satisfactory ratings for  this SCA.

The nature of  the enforcement action is based on the seriousness of the impact or potential  impact of the non-compliance on health, safety, security, the environment and  international obligations, as well as the circumstances that led to it. Depending  on the severity of the problem, more than one enforcement action may be  required to deal with a non-compliance.</p>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC escalated compliance enforcement actions in  19 instances against licensees in the medical, industrial, academic and  research, and commercial sectors. In 12&nbsp;instances, CNSC staff issued  orders to licensees and directed them to take immediate corrective measures. Eleven  of the orders were issued by  inspectors and one by a designated officer. In each case, the licensee  immediately complied with the order; however, the order remained in effect  until the licensee addressed all terms and conditions of the order. Once the  CNSC was satisfied that the licensee had addressed the terms and conditions of  the order, the order was closed. All orders issued in 2014 have been closed. Table 4 shows details of orders issued to  licensees. </p>  <p>CNSC designated officers issued AMPs<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in seven instances. Three of these were reviewed by the Commission following a  request for such a review by the person named in the AMP. All seven AMPs issued in 2014 have been paid.

</details>  </figure>  <h4>4.2.6 Reported events</h4>  <p>In Canada, more than 60,000 workers use nuclear substances in  a variety of environments and settings every day. Licensees are required to have programs in place for the management of  unplanned events and accidents. Mandatory reporting to the CNSC is required for  certain types of events. The situations that warrant mandatory reporting and  the content of the reports are set out in CNSC regulations.</p>  <p>As shown in Figure 19, there were 147 events related to nuclear substances reported  to the CNSC in 2014 by licensees in the four nuclear sectors covered in this  report. As discussed in section 3.1, the INES tool has been used for the first  time to categorize events in the sectors covered by this report. Of the 147  events, 141 were ranked as INES Level 0 (no safety significance), and five were  ranked as Level 1 (anomaly) due to the amount of nuclear substances involved  and the type of event reported (loss of nuclear substances). <a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/ines.pdf">Additional information on the INES tool</a> can be found on the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.</p>  <p>The remaining  event, ranked as Level 2 (incident), was the event at a fixed gauge facility,  involving a group of workers (who were not NEWs) who received radiation doses  above the public dose limit of 1 mSv. This event is described in detail in  section 4.2.1,</p>  <p>Details of events reported by licensees are presented in  this document at the overall level; those relating to high-energy research  particle accelerator facilities are presented in detail in section 9.2.4. </p>  <p>For all reported events,  the licensees implemented appropriate response measures to mitigate the impacts  of the events and to limit radiation exposure to workers and the public. These  measures were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

</details>  </figure>  <p><strong>Malfunctioning or damaged  devices</strong></p>  <p>There were 52 events  related to damaged or malfunctioning devices or systems. Of these events, two involved  malfunctioning systems that occurred at high-energy research particle  accelerator facilities and are further described in section 9.2.4. The remaining 50 events fall into two  categories: damaged devices and malfunctioning devices. Of these, 38 involved  damaged devices where:</p>  <ul>
<li>24 involved damage to portable gauges, which were hit or run  over by vehicles at construction sites </li>
<li>seven involved damage to fixed gauges, with most cases related  to damage to the shutter handle</li>
<li>seven involved damage to exposure devices from a drop or an  impact</li>  </ul>  <p>None of the  above resulted in damage to the source or resulted in source leakage. </p>  <p>The remaining 12  events involved malfunctioning devices, where:</p>  <ul>
<li>eight involved malfunctioning fixed gauges where the shutter  failed to close properly </li>
<li>two involved malfunctioning exposure devices where each sealed  source failed to retract into the shielded position </li>
<li>one involved a malfunctioning portable gauge</li>
<li>one involved a malfunctioning radiation detector calibrator</li>  </ul>  <p>All malfunctioning  devices were taken out of service as required by the regulations. None of the  events resulted in radiation exposure to any person above the annual  public regulatory dose limit of 1 mSv. All  of these events are closed.</p>  <p><strong>Spill or contamination</strong></p>  <p>There were 39 events  related to spills or contamination of personnel reported. Of these: </p>  <ul>
<li>36 involved contamination resulting from mishandling of unsealed  nuclear substances </li>
<li>three involving spills during the production of fluorine-18 </li>  </ul>  <p>These events  only include situations where spills or contamination occur outside of fume  hoods, hot cells or other normal means of containment. In every case, the  nuclear substances involved had half-lives ranging from a few hours to a few  days. In all cases, the workers received a dose well below the annual public  regulatory dose limit of 1 mSv. All of  these events are closed.</p>  <h5>Missing or found nuclear substances</h5>  <p>In 2014, there  were 17 reported events involving missing or found nuclear substances, of which  14 were reports of lost or stolen nuclear substances. The sealed sources or  radiation devices were recovered in seven instances. At the time of writing, seven  events remain open because the sources or radiation devices have not been  recovered. The remaining three events were related to the discovery of radiation  devices or sealed sources.</p>  <p>These events are reported  in the <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/reports/lost_stolen_ss_rd/"><em>Lost or Stolen Sealed Sources and Radiation  Devices Report</em></a>, which is updated regularly. </p>  <p>The following events  were presented by CNSC staff at Commission public meetings:</p>  <ul>
<li>During  March and April 2014, the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and Sunnybrook  Research Institute reported two events involving the loss of one moderate-risk (Category  3) and 26 low-risk (Category 4 and 5) sealed sources. Most of the sealed  sources involved in these two events pose negligible risk to the environment and  to the health and safety of workers and the public. To date, only the Category  3 source and one Category 5 source related to one event have been recovered.  The remaining 25 low-risk sources are lost and unaccounted for. Sunnybrook has  implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence of this type of event. CNSC  staff reviewed these actions and found them satisfactory. CNSC staff presented  this event at the August 21, 2014 Commission public meeting, at which time the  matter was closed (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=186&amp;yr=2014">August 20 and 21, 2014 meeting minutes</a>). Sunnybrook is based in Toronto, ON and  holds CNSC licences for medical and research applications.</li>
<li>In April  2014, the Alberta Health Services reported an event involving two low-risk  (Category 4) disused brachytherapy sealed sources containing cesium-137, which  were found in a machine shop at Alberta Health Services' Cross Cancer Institute  in Edmonton, AB. Alberta Health Services safely moved the sources to a secure  location to ensure that they posed no risk to workers, the public or the  environment. This event was ranked as INES Level 1 (anomaly). Alberta Health  Services implemented appropriate corrective measures to prevent recurrence of  this event, which were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory.  CNSC staff reported this event at the August 21, 2014 Commission public  meeting, at which time the matter was closed (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=186&amp;yr=2014">August 20 and 21, 2014 meeting minutes</a>). Alberta Health Services holds various  licences related to the possession, use, storage, transfer, import and export  of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment.</li>
<li>In November  2014, the CNSC laboratory reported an event involving the loss and subsequent  recovery of a low-risk (Category 4) cesium-137 source that was used during a  training session. Upon discovery of the lost source, the CNSC laboratory took  immediate measures to mitigate the impacts of the event and to limit  radiation exposure to workers and the public. The event, which ranked as INES Level 1 (anomaly), presented a low risk  to workers, the public and the environment. CNSC staff presented this event orally  at the November 5, 2014 Commission public meeting (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=188&amp;yr=2014">November 5, 2014 meeting minutes</a>) and provided a detailed update at the June 17,  2015 Commission public meeting (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=194&amp;yr=2015">June 17, 2015 meeting minutes</a>). The CNSC laboratory holds a licence for  the possession and use of nuclear substances for training purposes. Complete  information about the licensed activities conducted at the CNSC laboratory is  presented in section 3.2.3.</li>  </ul>  <ul>
<li>Four  events involved portable gauges containing low-risk (Category 4) sealed sources.  Three gauges were stolen from vehicles and one was lost during transport. One  of the three stolen portable gauges and the portable gauge lost during  transport were recovered. The INES tool was used to classify the loss or theft  of these radiation devices and, as a result, the event was given an INES Level  1 (anomaly) rating. The events where portable gauges have not been recovered remain  open and are being tracked by CNSC staff. </li>
<li>Two  events involved the loss of very low-risk sealed sources or devices (Category&nbsp;5)  following licensee inventory checks. In both cases, the sources involved were  sufficiently low activity that a licence would not be required for their  possession and in both instances the licensee found the missing source or  device subsequently. These events are closed.</li>
<li>One event  involved an industrial radiography exposure device containing a high-risk (Category  2) sealed source, which was stolen along with the vehicle in which it was  stored. The licensee recovered both the device and vehicle the following day. This  event is closed.</li>
<li>One event involved the loss of a very low-risk  europium-152 source (Category 5) used for instrument calibration. The licensee investigated  the event and concluded that the sealed source likely fell to the floor and was  inadvertently discarded in normal waste by cleaning staff. This source poses no  risk to workers, the public or the environment. This event is closed.</li>
<li>One  event involved the theft of two packages containing a total of approximately 40  gigabecquerels (GBq) of technetium-99m (a radioisotope used for medical imaging  diagnostics), which were stolen from a delivery vehicle. These packages present  very low risk to workers, the public and the environment, as technetium-99m has  a half-life of six hours and decays to background levels within three days. This  event is closed and has been ranked as an INES Level 1 (anomaly). </li>
<li>One  event involved three very low-risk (Category 5) cesium-137 calibration sources  that were discovered in an unlicensed location. CNSC inspectors retrieved the  sources and safely disposed of them at a CNSC-licensed facility. This event is  closed.</li>
<li>One event  involved a vehicle carrying scrap metal that triggered portal alarms at a metal  recycling facility. The source of radiation was identified as a dew point  detector containing a very low-risk (Category 5) sealed source. The owner retrieved  the radiation device and subsequently transferred it to a person licensed to  possess such a device. This event is closed.</li>
<li>One  event involved a liquid scintillation counter containing a very low-risk  (Category 5) cesium-137 source that the licensee reported missing following an  unauthorized transfer for disposal. The sealed source posed a negligible risk  to workers, the public and the environment. This event is closed.</li>
<li>One  event involved an X-ray fluorescence analyzer containing a very low-risk (Category&nbsp;5)  sealed source that a licensee reported stolen from a vehicle while in transport.  The event remains open and is being tracked by CNSC staff.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Breach of security</strong></p>  <p>In 2014, there were nine  events reported to the CNSC relating to security breaches. Some security  breaches are actually safety barrier breaches, which typically involve people  entering restricted work areas that licensees have established prior to the use  of industrial radiography exposure devices. These types of events pose a risk  of potential exposure to persons entering the area while industrial radiography  work is being conducted. Although these events were categorized as security  breaches, all of the safety barrier breaches were a result of licensee workers  not following procedures to establish or control such a barrier. </p>  <p>There were nine reported events in 2014:</p>  <ul>
<li>Four involved  safety barrier breaches where people entered restricted work areas that  were established prior to the use of exposure devices for industrial radiography  work. In all cases, the people crossing the barriers received doses well below  the public regulatory dose limit of 1 mSv. These events are closed.</li>
<li>Three involved  break-ins at licensee storage facilities or clinics that had nuclear substances  or radiation devices. There was no access to, or theft of, the nuclear  substances or radiation devices during these incidents. These events are  closed.</li>
<li>One involved  a key lock box for a brachytherapy unit that was found to have been forced  open. The licensee investigation concluded that the lock box was forced open by  a physicist authorized to work in the area who had forgotten the access code. Appropriate  corrective measures were taken by the licensee. These measures were reviewed by  CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory. This event is closed.</li>
<li>One was related  to one of the high-energy research particle accelerator facilities and is further  described in section 9.2.4.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Packaging and transport</strong></p>  <p>Approximately 1  million packages containing nuclear substances are safely transported each year  in Canada. In 2014, there were 30 events reported to the CNSC relating to  packaging and transport.</p>  <p>The following  event was presented by CNSC staff at a Commission public meeting:</p>  <ul>
<li>Over a three-day  period in August 2014, Isologic Innovative Pharmaceuticals Ltd. delivered  packages with external contamination to various hospitals in the Montréal, QC  area. The packages had external contamination above regulatory limits. CNSC  staff presented this event at the November 5, 2014 Commission public meeting  (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=188&amp;yr=2014">November 5, 2014 meeting minutes</a>). Isologic implemented appropriate  corrective measures to prevent recurrence of this event, which were reviewed by  CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory. CNSC staff presented an update on this  event at the December 18, 2014 Commission public meeting, at which time the  matter was closed (refer to the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/the-commission/meetings/documents_browse/index?mid=187&amp;yr=2014">December 18, 2014 meeting minutes</a>).</li>  </ul>  <p>Following the event involving contaminated  packages from Isologic, CNSC staff issued a safety notice to all licensees that  receive shipments of unsealed nuclear substances, in order to emphasize the  need to check incoming packages for contamination as per industry best  practices. In 2015, the  CNSC will increase regulatory focus on licensees that process and distribute  unsealed nuclear substances, with inspections focusing on the preparation,  handling and receipt of packages that contain unsealed nuclear substances. </p>  <p>The following  is a summary of other events of no safety significance that were not presented  by CNSC staff at Commission public meetings, and which are all closed:</p>  <ul>
<li>Twelve events  involved minor accidents involving vehicles transporting the packages, with no  reported damage to the packages following the accidents.</li>
<li>Eight events  involved external damage to packages. The licensee investigations concluded  that there was no external contamination and that the internal containers were  not breached.  </li>
<li>Six events  involved delays in delivery of the packages. </li>
<li>Three  events involved internal contamination of the package discovered following the opening  of the packages. In all cases, the contamination was contained within the  package. There was no spread of contamination.</li>  </ul>  <h5>Summary statements</h5>  <p>For all of the  events reported, the licensees implemented adequate response measures to  mitigate the impacts of the events and to limit radiation exposure to workers or  any radiological impact on the environment. CNSC staff reviewed these measures, along with licensee corrective  actions to prevent recurrence of the events, and found them to be satisfactory. </p>
<h3 id="sec-4.3">4.3 Stakeholder engagement</h3>  <p>CNSC staff believe that increased awareness and better  understanding of regulatory requirements by licensees and other persons  regulated by the CNSC lead to increased safety in the workplace. Increased  safety is reflected by improved licensee compliance ratings for subsectors that  have been targeted by CNSC staff for focused stakeholder engagement activities.</p>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC continued to create more opportunities for  licensees and other persons to interact with the regulator outside the scope of  inspection and licensing activities. The CNSC achieved this through stakeholder  engagement activities across Canada in the form of outreach sessions. </p>  <h4>4.3.1 Outreach sessions</h4>  <p>Stakeholder engagement in the form of outreach is integral to  the CNSC's objectives. Since 2009, the CNSC has offered an outreach program for  licensees that use nuclear substances. The  presentations made by CNSC staff and discussions associated with outreach are  meant to inform licensees and other persons regulated by the CNSC on  upcoming and recent regulatory changes, and provide education regarding the CNSC's  expectations for licensing and compliance requirements.</p>  <p>The 2014  CNSC outreach program for licensees using nuclear substances reached 23&nbsp;cities  across Canada. Topics covered included: </p>  <ul>

<li>information  on the forthcoming amendments to the <em>Radiation  Protection Regulations</em> and the <em>Packaging  and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations</em><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>  </ul>  <p>In 2014, CNSC  staff also delivered a special regulatory workshop at the request of the diagnostic  and therapeutic nuclear medicine subsector in the Montréal, QC area.</p>  <h4>4.3.2 Industrial radiography  working group</h4>  <p>In 2009, the CNSC and industry representatives established a  joint CNSC/industrial radiography working group. The group's objective is to  foster communications between the CNSC and the industry, discuss best practices  and safety performance, and stay informed of new developments in the field from  both the technical and regulatory perspectives. </p>  <p>The industrial  radiography working group held two regular meetings in 2014 to discuss safety  culture and new developments that may impact the radiography industry, and to  review the mandate and membership of the working group. The working group also  held its annual meetings with the radiography industry at large in Nisku, AB  and Ottawa, ON. It adopted safety culture as its meeting theme for 2014.  Representatives from France also participated in the Ottawa meeting, providing  information on how the radiography industry is regulated in France.</p>  <p>CNSC staff, with input from the working group, developed a booklet titled, <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/pubs_catalogue/uploads/WSIR-eng.pdf"><em>Working Safely with Industrial Radiography</em></a>.  The document contains guidelines on the safe handling and use of industrial  radiography exposure devices, and provides basic information about radiation exposure  to people working with (or near) these devices. </p>  <p>The working  group continued to support the development of the <a href="http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/nuclear-substances/exposure-device-operators/CSA-standard-PCP-09">new CSA certification guide  for exposure device operators PCP-09</a>.&nbsp;This new guide will replace the CNSC's current regulatory  guide G-229,<em> Certification of Exposure  Device Operators,</em> and address the most current safety, security and  regulatory requirements for the industry.   CNSC staff will implement this guide starting in 2015.</p>  <h4>4.3.3 Canadian  Radiation Protection Association </h4>  <p>For almost  three decades CNSC staff have delivered regulatory-focused presentations and  participated in regulatory workshops at the Canadian Radiation Protection  Association (CRPA) annual conferences. At the 2014 conference in Vancouver, BC,  CNSC staff delivered 11 presentations and participated in an open discussion  panel on regulatory topics. </p>  <p>In addition, in 2014,  CNSC staff and representatives from the CRPA established a joint working group,  the proposed mission of which is &quot;to be a forum for implementing  solutions and resolving issues in order to promote a strong radiation safety  culture while respecting and understanding the interest and expectations of  stakeholders.&quot; This working group plans to meet twice a year or more frequently  if required.</p>  <p>The group's first meeting was held in September 2014 and  focused on developing the terms of reference for the group and on the  expectations of each participant. </p>  <h4>4.3.4 Canadian  Organization of Medical Physicists</h4>  <p>The  Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP) represents medical  physicists working in radiotherapy facilities in the medical sector and in  isotope production cyclotron facilities in the commercial sector.&nbsp;Many  certified radiation safety  officers at Class II nuclear facilities are members of COMP. In 2014, CNSC staff outreach  activities included presenting talks and posters on regulatory issues at the  COMP annual conference, attending the COMP winter school and submitting  quarterly articles on regulatory topics of interest to radiotherapy licensees to  the COMP <em>Interactions</em> bulletin.</p>  <p>CNSC staff  also worked with COMP to develop quality assurance testing requirements for  specific radiotherapy facility safety systems, which are required under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2000-205/index.html"><em>Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations</em></a><em>.</em>&nbsp;When  completed, these testing requirements will be incorporated into technical quality  control guidelines published through the <a href="http://www.cpqr.ca/">Canadian Partnership for Quality  Radiotherapy</a>.</p>  <h4>4.3.5 Portable gauge workshops</h4>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC developed a regulatory workshop for  portable gauge licensees in an effort to promote compliance and safety culture  within this industrial subsector. CNSC staff believe that improved industry  engagement will be effective in addressing such issues. Positive results have already  been observed in a marked improvement in compliance and by fewer CNSC enforcement  actions taken against these licensees. </p>  <p>In June  2014, CNSC staff held a pilot workshop for portable gauge radiation safety officers  in the Toronto, ON area. The workshop consisted of presentations delivered  by CNSC staff followed by a question-and-answer session and general discussions.  Participants responded positively. Based on this success, similar workshops  will be repeated across  Canada in 2015.</p>  <h4>4.3.6 Newsletters</h4>  <p>In 2009, the CNSC introduced  the <em>DNSR Newsletter</em> –typically published twice a year by the  Directorate of Nuclear Substance Regulation, with special editions as needed  –as a forum for disseminating regulatory and  safety information to licensees that use nuclear substances and prescribed  equipment in Canada. The newsletter includes articles addressing various  regulatory compliance issues and is an integral part of the regulator's commitment  to keep both licensees and the public informed. While regular editions provide valuable  information to licensees in all sectors, special editions tend to focus  on a specific subsector as the main audience. </p>  <p>Two <em>DNSR Newsletter</em> editions were published in 2014. The regular edition provided timely  information such as updates to the CNSC compliance program and on the consultation  period for the then-draft new <em>Packaging  and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations</em>, while the special edition focused  on exposure device operators. All <a href="http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/nuclear-substances/directorate-of-nuclear-substance-regulation-newsletter/">published  newsletters</a> can be found on the CNSC website.</p>  <div>

<h2 id="sec-5">5 Medical sector</h2>  <p>This sector accounted for 536 CNSC licences and 9,003 nuclear  energy workers (NEWs) as of December 31, 2014. </p>  <p>Safety performance results are provided for all licensees in  the medical sector, with the following three subsectors highlighted in further  detail: diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine, radiation therapy and  veterinary nuclear medicine. </p>
<h3 id="sec-5.1">5.1 Safety performance summary</h3>  <p>Based on their evaluation and verification of licensee  performance, CNSC staff concluded that the safety performance of the medical  sector was satisfactory in 2014.</p>  <p>Doses received by NEWs in this sector remained low, with the  majority of workers receiving doses below 1 millisievert (mSv). No NEW received a dose in  excess of the annual regulatory limits.</p>  <p>Of the inspected licensees in this sector, 91.4% and 91.9% were  found to be compliant in the operating performance and radiation protection safety  and control areas (SCAs), respectively. Licensees took appropriate corrective  actions, satisfactory to CNSC staff, to address the non-compliances noted  during the inspections. </p>  <p>The CNSC took no escalated compliance enforcement actions  against licensees in the medical sector in 2014.</p>
<h3 id="sec-5.2">5.2 Safety performance results and trends</h3>  <h4>5.2.1 Doses to workers</h4>  <p>As indicated in Figure  20,  NEWs in the diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine subsector continued to  receive higher doses than workers in other medical subsectors. This is a result  of directly administering nuclear substances to patients and constantly working  in environments where patients are in close proximity to health professionals. Note  that the vast majority of these workers received doses below 5 mSv. Doses  received by NEWs in the diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine subsector  from 2010 to 2014 are shown in Figure 21. </p>  <p>NEWs in the veterinary nuclear medicine and radiation  therapy subsectors continued to receive low doses, with the majority of workers  receiving doses below 1 mSv. </p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

<h4>5.2.2 Operating  performance </h4>  <p>The overall compliance rating for operating performance in  the medical sector was 91.4% in 2014, as shown  in Figure 22. Performance in this SCA has remained  constant since 2012, when 90.7% of licensees inspected by the CNSC were found  to be compliant.

Whereas  overall licensee performance in this SCA has remained largely unchanged since  2012, a downward trend is observed in the fixed gauge subsector. Note that the  radiation doses received by workers in the fixed gauge subsector are the lowest  in the industrial sector.</p>  <p>Fixed gauges have a high degree of reliability and their use  involves little interaction with the worker after the gauge is installed and in  use. During field observations, CNSC inspectors noted deficiencies in licensee  oversight of fixed gauges during normal operation; these deficiencies resulted  in the failure to follow approved procedures. The CNSC has recognized that the  lower performance of this subsector remains an issue. Accordingly, it increased  its regulatory oversight of the fixed gauge subsector in 2014. </p>  <p>Non-compliances observed by CNSC staff in the industrial  sector were related to failure to comply with regulatory requirements applicable  to worker obligations, retention of records, sealed source leak testing, use of  required equipment and following procedures specified in their CNSC licences. Using  the graded approach to compliance enforcement, CNSC staff used a range of  compliance enforcement measures commensurate with the severity of the  non-compliance to address non-compliances with regulatory requirements. In some  instances, based on safety significance, there was an escalation of enforcement  actions. See section 6.2.4 for further details. </p>  <p>In all cases, licensees addressed these non-compliances to  the satisfaction of the CNSC.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

Most of the enforcement  actions were taken against licensees in the industrial radiography and portable  gauge subsectors. The industrial sector saw a significant drop in the number of  orders issued in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to significantly fewer  orders being issued to licensees in the portable gauge subsector. The performance  of the portable gauge subsector improved in all SCAs in 2014, demonstrating the  effectiveness of the outreach and compliance promotion efforts by CNSC staff. </p>  <p>All licensees to whom orders were issued complied with the  terms and conditions of the orders and implemented corrective measures to the satisfaction  of CNSC staff. All six licensees who were issued AMPs have paid their penalty  amounts. Details on the orders and AMPs issued can be found in section 4.2.5.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

<h2 id="sec-7">7 Academic and research</h2>  <p>This sector accounted for 229 CNSC licences and 3,612 nuclear  energy workers (NEWs) as of December 31, 2014. </p>  <p>Safety performance results are provided for all licensees  included in the academic and research sector, with one subsector – laboratory  studies and consolidated uses of nuclear substances – highlighted in further  detail.</p>  <p>There has been a steady decrease in the number of laboratory  studies and consolidated uses of nuclear substances licences over the years,  with a recent drop of 22.2% – from 198&nbsp;licences in 2010 to 154  licences in 2014. This change is in response to institutions finding alternative  methods of performing research that do not require the use of nuclear  substances.</p>  <p>In 2013, the CNSC inspection program for the laboratory  studies and consolidated uses of nuclear substances subsector was revised,  based on the positive safety performance ratings and the low-risk level  associated with these licensed activities. The frequency of CNSC inspections was  changed from annually to every two years, which is reflected in the 30.8%  decrease in the number of inspections conducted in 2014 for this subsector. </p>
<h3 id="sec-7.1">7.1 Safety performance summary</h3>  <p>The academic and research sector continued to show good  safety performance in 2014. </p>  <p>Doses received by NEWs in this sector remained very low,  with the majority of workers receiving doses below 0.5 millisievert (mSv).  </p>  <p>Of the inspected licensees in this sector, 87.4% and 87.3% were  found to be in compliance in the operating performance and radiation protection  safety and control areas (SCAs), respectively. Licensees took appropriate  corrective actions, satisfactory to CNSC staff, to address the non-compliances  noted during the inspections. </p>  <p>The CNSC took two escalated enforcement actions against a licensee  in the academic and research sector, consisting of one order and one  administrative monetary penalty. Further details are provided in section 4.2.5.</p>  <h4>7.1.1 CNSC laboratory</h4>  <p>Doses received by NEWs working at the CNSC laboratory  remained very low, with most workers receiving doses below 0.5 mSv. There was one reported event at the CNSC  laboratory involving a missing low-risk (Category 4) cesium-137 source. This  event is discussed in detail in section 4.2.6. As a follow-up to this event, CNSC  staff conducted a compliance inspection at the CNSC laboratory in December 2014  and concluded that the use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment at  the laboratory is safe. </p>

The action consisted of an order to  a servicing company in possession of a radiation device not listed on the licence.  The licensee complied with the terms and conditions of the order and  implemented corrective measures that have been reviewed by CNSC staff and found  to be satisfactory. Details on the order issued can be found in section 4.2.5.</p>
<h2 id="sec-9">9 High-energy research particle accelerator facilities</h2>  <p>In accordance with  the CNSC risk-informed regulatory approach described in section 1 of this report, the two major high-energy  research particle accelerator facilities operating under CNSC licences in  Canada: TRIUMF Accelerators Inc. (TRIUMF), in British Columbia, and Canadian  Light Source Inc. (CLS), in Saskatchewan, fall under the major facilities category. Both facilities have licence  conditions handbooks and are subject to more frequent and more detailed compliance  verification&nbsp;activities than other licensees covered in this report.&nbsp;Consequently,  the compliance performance for these two facilities is addressed under this  section, using an approach consistent with reporting for other major CNSC-regulated  facilities in Canada.</p>  <p>This sector accounts for four CNSC licences and 429 nuclear  energy workers (NEWs) as of December 31, 2014.</p>
<h3 id="sec-9.1">9.1 Safety performance summary and sector overview</h3>  <p>Based on their evaluation and verification of licensee  performance, CNSC staff concluded that high-energy research particle  accelerator facility safety performance remained stable in 2014.</p>  <p>Doses received by NEWs in this sector remained low, with the  majority of NEWs receiving doses below 1 mSv.</p>  <p>Performance ratings for high-energy research particle  accelerator facilities are categorized into 14 safety and control areas (SCAs),  as described in section 3.5. Compliance in most  SCAs remained satisfactory in 2014. </p>  <p>The CNSC took no enforcement action against either  high-energy research particle accelerator facility in 2014.</p>  <p>There were three events reported to the CNSC involving the  two high-energy research particle accelerator facilities in 2014. All ranked as  Level 0 (no safety significance) on the International  Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale.</p>  <h4>9.1.1 Observations, major projects and developments</h4>  <p>Both high-energy research particle accelerator facilities  continue to expand the scope of their operations. For example, the Advanced  Rare IsotopE Laboratory (ARIEL) project at TRIUMF Accelerators Inc. involves  developing a high-power superconducting electron accelerator that will expand  Canada's capabilities to produce and study isotopes for physics and medicine.  Commissioning tests on the accelerator commenced in 2014 with the first  accelerated beam achieved in July 2014.</p>  <p>TRIUMF is also leading a collaborative effort with several  other Canadian facilities to deliver an alternative technology for producing  technetium-99m, the world's most commonly used medical isotope. The goal of  this project is to enable the use of existing medical cyclotrons to produce  technetium-99m without the need for a nuclear reactor. More information on this  project can be found on the <a href="http://www.triumf.ca/home/for-media/medical-isotopes">TRIUMF website</a>.</p>  <p>The Medical Isotope Project at Canadian Light Source Inc. (CLS)  consists of a 40 kW, 35&nbsp;mega-electron volt linear electron accelerator facility  to investigate an alternative technology for producing molybdenum-99, which is used to generate technetium-99m. More  information on this project can be found on the <a href="http://www.lightsource.ca/operations/medicalisotopes/">CLS website</a>.</p>  <p>In 2014, the  new accelerator was commissioned at incremental power levels up to 10 kW, which  is the minimum power required for trial production of molybdenum-99. In August  2014, once commissioning at 10 kW had been completed, an operating licence was  issued, which permitted CLS to begin production of molybdenum-99. The first  delivery of molybdenum-99 for processing and testing by the Prairie Isotope  Production Enterprise in Winnipeg, MB, which is CLS's partner in the Medical  Isotope Project, was achieved in November 2014. </p>  <h4>9.1.2 Compliance  program</h4>  <p>The inspection program for these facilities utilizes focused  inspections that address one or more of the 14 applicable SCAs. The number of  inspections performed in a single year may vary from one per facility to as  many as three or four, depending upon factors such as the nature of the  licensed activities taking place. On average, CNSC staff conduct two  inspections per facility per year. </p>  <p>In addition to onsite inspections, compliance monitoring  activities include a review of mandatory reports submitted by the licensee.  These include reports on incidents or unusual events, follow-up on corrective  actions identified during previous inspections, and an annual compliance report  summarizing facility operations. Some of the parameters included in high-energy  research particle accelerator annual compliance reports are:</p>  <ul>
<li>major  safety and regulatory compliance-related activities undertaken by various key  working groups and committees</li>
<li>significant  changes and improvements to the facility and related safety systems</li>
<li>results  of ongoing monitoring of radiation dose rates throughout the site</li>
<li>testing  and calibration of radiation monitors and access control systems</li>
<li>radiation  doses incurred by all staff and contractors</li>
<li>accelerator  operating statistics</li>
<li>sealed source inventory </li>
<li>site  emissions and environmental monitoring results</li>
<li>plans for any significant future changes to the  site</li>  </ul>
<h3 id="sec-9.2">9.2 Safety performance results and trends</h3>  <h4>9.2.1 Doses to workers</h4>  <p>The doses received by high-energy research particle accelerator  facility NEWs continued to be low, with the majority of NEWs receiving doses  below 1 mSv per year.</p>  <p>Figure  38  shows the differences in worker doses between TRIUMF and CLS. As the figure  indicates, NEW doses at CLS are generally much lower than those at TRIUMF. This  is the result of the fundamentally different nature of the accelerators used  and the licensed activities conducted at these two facilities. </p>  <p>The collective dose for all NEWs at TRIUMF was 143 mSv,  continuing the trend of steady yearly decreases at TRIUMF over the past decade.  The total dose to all workers was at its lowest level in the past 35 years of  operation. The maximum individual dose was 6.3 mSv and the maximum cumulative  dose to any NEW over the current five-year dosimetry period (2011 to 2015) was  24.3 mSv.</p>  <p>The collective dose for all NEWs at CLS was 1.1 mSv and was  consistent with the results from previous years. The maximum individual dose  was 0.14 mSv and the maximum cumulative dose to any NEW over the current five-year  dosimetry period (2011 to 2015) is less than 1.0 mSv.  </p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

</details>  </figure>  <h4>9.2.2 Compliance  performance</h4>  <p>CNSC staff conducted four inspections at TRIUMF in 2014.  These inspections encompassed the following SCAs:</p>  <ul>
<li>human performance  management</li>
<li>waste management</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>safeguards</li>  </ul>  <p>Other areas addressed during these inspections included  conventional health and safety issues, the  preliminary decommissioning plan and the associated financial guarantees.  In addition, the major focus of one inspection was follow-up on corrective  actions related to reported incidents that addressed aspects of several SCAs.</p>  <p>TRIUMF was required to implement corrective actions to  address 11 non-compliances arising from these inspections and from desktop  reviews of event reports. In addition, four recommendations were made relating  to potential improvements to various procedures and one with regard to  upgrading safety interlock systems. </p>  <p>The licensee fully addressed three corrective actions  related to site security and one related to incident reporting before the end  of 2014. The remaining seven corrective actions were all issued to TRIUMF in  November and December of 2014. TRIUMF had already implemented immediate  remedial measures to mitigate any risk to the safety of personnel, and all of  the actions required were in the nature of longer-term actions to prevent recurrences  of the observed non-compliances. They involve revisions to procedures and  documents, retraining of staff, and internal auditing of TRIUMF operations. CNSC  staff are monitoring progress on the remaining actions, and acceptable progress  has been demonstrated to date. It is expected that all actions will be  completed by the middle of 2015. TRIUMF has also indicated that all five  recommendations will be implemented. </p>  <p>Combined airborne and liquid effluent releases of nuclear  substances from the site remained stable at the normal, extremely low levels  expected for TRIUMF. Total site releases were 1.6% of the derived release limits,  which is equivalent to a maximum dose of 0.016 mSv or 1.6% of the general  public dose limit. </p>  <p>CNSC staff conducted one inspection at CLS in 2014. The  inspection focused on the following areas:</p>  <ul>
<li>human performance management</li>
<li>radiation protection program</li>
<li>the Medical Isotope Project</li>  </ul>  <p>CLS was required to implement corrective actions to address  seven specific non-compliances noted during the inspection. None of these  non-compliances presented a significant risk to workers, the public, the  environment or the maintenance of security. All of the required corrective  actions have been satisfactorily addressed by CLS.</p>  <p>There are no airborne  and liquid effluent releases of nuclear substances from CLS.</p>  <p>Performance ratings  for TRIUMF and CLS are categorized into the 14 SCAs. The ratings are derived  from the compliance activities, reported events and enforcement actions  described in the preceding three sections. The 2014 performance ratings for  both TRIUMF and CLS are summarized in Table 6. </p>  <table class="table table-bordered">

All three events  were ranked as Level 0 (no&nbsp;safety significance) on the International  Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale. The CLS event involved the non-approved  bypass of one component of a safety system. The two reported events at TRIUMF  dealt with:</p>  <ul>
<li>the  failure of a target window, which resulted in the unintended release of a small  quantity of nuclear substances via the nuclear exhaust system</li>
<li>a breach  of the site perimeter fence and the theft of non-radioactive recycled copper  from the site </li>  </ul>  <p>In February 2014,  CLS reported that the oxygen deficiency monitoring system alarm horn located in  the control room had been temporarily disconnected by operating room staff due to  an ongoing problem with nuisance alarms. Operating staff implemented a periodic  visual check of the oxygen monitor display as an interim measure while the  alarm was disconnected. While disconnecting the alarm has no impact on the  function of the local audible and visual alarms located in each of the seven  zones monitored for potential oxygen deficiency hazards, it does weaken the  overall defense in depth of the system. CLS subsequently retrained operating  staff to emphasize that disconnecting the alarm is not an acceptable practice  under any circumstances. CLS is in the process of replacing this system, which  has had recurrent problems with generating false alarms. CNSC staff followed up  on this incident during the 2014 inspection and concur that the corrective  actions that CLS has implemented are sufficient to prevent recurrence of this  type of incident in the future.</p>  <p>In April 2014, TRIUMF reported that a target window on a  newly redesigned target used for the production of the medical isotope strontium-82/rubidium-82  had failed during two consecutive test irradiations, resulting in the  unintended release of up to 44 gigabecquerel (GBq) of the gaseous krypton-79 by-product  contained within the target. The estimated maximum dose to the general public  resulting from these releases was 0.00043 mSv, or less than 0.1% of the general  public dose limit. The maximum potential onsite dose to TRIUMF staff was  estimated to be less than 0.015 mSv, which again is less than 0.1% of the  applicable NEW dose limit. TRIUMF suspended all further testing of the target. Subsequent  re-analysis indicated that the failure was due to an unanticipated thermal  stress on the target window. The target is now being redesigned to address this  problem. Use of the target has been suspended by TRIUMF pending completion of  the redesign and submission of the associated design documents for review by  CNSC staff.  </p>  <p>In December 2014, TRIUMF reported that the perimeter fence  near the onsite scrap metal recycling depot had been breached and that a quantity  of recycled copper had been stolen from the site. There was no access to any of  the radiological work areas on the site. Additional security precautions were  subsequently implemented in that area.</p>  <p>In addition to these two events, in September 2014, TRIUMF  reported a near-miss incident in which a worker in the new ARIEL electron  accelerator facility was not accounted for during a pre-lockup search of the  electron hall. These searches are conducted in a systematic manner prior to securing  the accelerator vault to ensure no one remains inside the room before  initiating operation of the accelerator. Once the search and lockup is  complete, there is a delay in which a pre-irradiation warning alarm is  activated, after which power can be applied to begin conditioning and  stabilizing the accelerator before actually injecting electrons to produce an  accelerated beam. The worker responded appropriately to the pre-irradiation  warning alarm and the warm-up sequence was terminated automatically by the door  interlock system when the worker exited the area. The worker did not incur any  radiation exposure as a result of this incident. TRIUMF's internal  investigation of the incident identified multiple contributing factors, ranging  from a failure to properly implement procedures and inadequate training to inadequacies  in the siting of the search switches, which otherwise might have ensured that  the worker was detected during the search of the electron hall. All operations  of the electron linear accelerator were voluntarily suspended by TRIUMF for the  remainder of 2014 pending completion of multiple corrective actions required to  address these deficiencies. </p>  <h5>Summary statement</h5>  <p>None of the three reported events or the near-miss incident had  any adverse radiological effects on the environment, or resulted in workers or  the public receiving doses in excess of the regulatory limits. In all cases, the  licensees implemented adequate response measures to mitigate the impacts of the  events and to limit radiation exposure to workers or any radiological impact on  the environment. All of these measures were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to  be satisfactory.</p>  <h4>9.2.5 Licensing</h4>  <p>The CNSC operating licences issued to TRIUMF and CLS include  licence conditions handbooks that define key documents and compliance criteria  related to the facility. The Commission has delegated its authority to a designated  officer to make changes to the licence conditions handbooks with the provision  that such changes must not reduce the overall level of safety for the facility. </p>  <p>For TRIUMF, multiple changes were combined into a single  revision of the handbook in 2014. Some of these changes were administrative in  nature and included updates to TRIUMF documents related to:</p>  <ul>
<li>calibration of effluent air monitor calibration procedures</li>
<li>procedures for the packaging and transport of  nuclear substances</li>  </ul>  <p>Three of the changes were related to facility operations and  the production of medical and research isotopes. These were:</p>  <ul>
<li>the addition of a new safety analysis report for  the use of thorium oxide targets in conjunction with the Isotope Separator and  Accelerator actinide target system, including acceptance of the proposed plan  for conducting a single, low-current test run using a thorium oxide target</li>
<li>an increase in the production limit for the medical  isotope technetium-99m, which allowed TRIUMF to perform production test runs on  one of the two TR-30 medical isotope cyclotrons</li>
<li>changes to the export limits for several by-product  isotopes contained within the potassium chloride target used to produce the  isotope silicon-32, which is used for oceanographic research and is shipped to  the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States for processing</li>  </ul>  The CLS licence conditions handbook was modified  for the first time in 2014. This involved updating various CLS document  references to more recent revisions. All of the revisions were administrative  in nature.  <div>

<h2 id="sec-10">10 Conclusion</h2>  <p>In 2014, CNSC staff continued their ongoing regulatory  oversight of licensees in four nuclear sectors (medical, industrial, academic  and research, and commercial) and two high-energy research particle accelerator  facilities. CNSC staff conducted compliance verification activities consisting  of field inspections, desktop reviews and technical assessments of licensee  activities, and concluded that the use of nuclear substances in Canada is safe.  The evaluations of findings for the safety and control areas (SCAs) covered in  this report show that, overall, licensees made adequate provisions for the  protection of the health, safety and security of persons and the environment  from the use of nuclear substances, and took the measures required to implement  Canada's international obligations.</p>  <p>Doses to workers remained very low in 2014 and followed a  constant trend when compared with previous years. Overall, over 99.9% of all  workers – including both nuclear energy workers (NEWs) and other workers –  received doses below the applicable CNSC regulatory dose limits. There were no NEWs  who exceeded the one- or five-year dose limits of 50 millisieverts (mSv) and 100 mSv, respectively. </p>  <p>There were two separate situations where, based on dosimetry  results, workers (who were not NEWs) exceeded the annual regulatory dose limit  of 1 mSv. In both situations, licensees responded in accordance with the Radiation Protection Regulations.  Neither situation resulted in any immediate adverse health consequences to the  workers.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conducted 1,453 inspections in 2014 to verify  compliance with CNSC regulatory requirements. All four nuclear sectors continued  to demonstrate good performance. CNSC staff found that 88.4% and 89.1% of  inspected licensees found to be in compliance with the operating performance  and radiation protection SCAs, respectively. The security SCA is reported on for  the first time in this report. CNSC staff found that adequate security  provisions were in place for 94.8% of inspected licensees. </p>  <p>Overall, licensees showed satisfactory compliance ratings in  the operating performance, radiation protection and security SCAs. Those  licensees failing to meet requirements took appropriate corrective measures to  address non-compliances found during inspections. All non-compliances were  being systematically tracked by CNSC staff until licensees take the appropriate  corrective measures to address them to the satisfaction of the CNSC. Corrective  measures put in place by licensees in 2014 were reviewed by CNSC staff and  found to be satisfactory. </p>  <p>In 2014, safety performance  for Canadian Light Source, a high-energy research particle accelerator facility,  was rated either satisfactory or fully satisfactory in all of the 14 SCAs  evaluated by CNSC staff. For the TRIUMF facility, two of the 14 SCAs evaluated  were rated below expectations while the other 12 SCAs were rated as  satisfactory or fully satisfactory. </p>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC took 19 escalated compliance enforcement actions  against licensees in the four nuclear sectors covered in this report, consisting  of 12 orders and seven administrative monetary penalties. All licensees to whom  orders were issued complied with the terms and conditions of the orders and implemented  corrective measures that were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to be  satisfactory. All of the administrative monetary penalties were paid. </p>  <p>No exposure  device operators or radiation safety officers at Class II nuclear facilities  were decertified in 2014.</p>  <p>In 2014, the CNSC adopted the International Nuclear and  Radiological Event Scale tool to report events in the nuclear substance sector.  Of the 147 events reported to the CNSC in 2014 in relation to nuclear  substances, the overwhelming majority (141)  were categorized as INES Level 0 (no safety significance). Five events were  ranked as Level 1 (anomaly) due to the amount of nuclear substances involved  and the type of event reported (loss of nuclear substances). One event – ranked  as Level 2 (incident) – involved members of the public receiving radiation  doses above the public dose limit of 1 mSv. No adverse health consequences are  expected from this event.</p>  <p>There were no  releases of a nuclear substance to the environment that had an adverse  radiological impact or that resulted in a person receiving a dose in excess of  the regulatory limit for members of the public. </p>  <p>For all reported events,  the licensees implemented appropriate response measures to mitigate the impacts  of the events and to limit radiation exposure to workers and the public. These  measures were reviewed by CNSC staff and found to be satisfactory.</p>  <p>In 2015, the CNSC focus  will continue to be on effective regulatory oversight with increased emphasis  on inventory management, contamination control and event reporting.</p>
<h2 id="sec-a">Appendix A: INES ranking of nuclear substance-related events</h2>  <p>The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES)  was revised in 2006 to include nuclear substance-related events. Since the  revision, a number of countries have been reporting these events to the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>  <p>Figure 39 and Table 7 show the  number of nuclear substance-related events that have been reported to the IAEA  between 2010 and 2014, along with their corresponding level. </p>  <p>A review of all events presented in the graph below  indicates that the ranking established by CNSC staff for the events presented  in this report is consistent with international practice.</p>  <figure class="col-md-12">

<h2 id="sec-b">Appendix B: Safety and control area naming conventions</h2>  <p>Safety and control areas (SCAs) used in this report reflect the standardized set and naming convention approved for CNSC licensed activities, as shown in column 1 of table 8. For historical reasons, a modified naming convention of SCAs (see column 2 of table 8) is used for the inspections of nuclear substance activities (e.g.,: nuclear substance radiation devices) as covered in this report. In the near future, the CNSC intends to adopt the standardized naming convention of SCAs for all types of licensees that use nuclear substances.
