</ul>  </div>  <h2 id="summary">Executive Summary</h2>  <p>This document presents the Regulatory Oversight Reports (ROR) for the Directorate of Nuclear Substance Regulation (DNSR) for the activities falling under its regulatory responsibilities. This report also covers Waste Nuclear Substance licenses, regulated by the Directorate of Nuclear Cycle and Facilities Regulation. The report is provided in two parts:</p>  <ul>  <li>Part I: Use of Nuclear Substances in Canada: 2019</li>  <li>Part II: Class IB Accelerators in Canada: 2018-2019</li>  </ul>  <p>The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect health, safety, security and the environment, implements Canada&#8217;s international commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and disseminates objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public. Licensees are responsible for operating their facilities safely and are required to implement programs that make adequate provision for meeting legislative and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>To assess the safety performance of licensees, the CNSC conducts regulatory oversight activities including inspections, reviews of reports submitted by licensees, reviews of events and incidents, and general communication and exchanges of information with licensees.</p>  <p>CNSC staff use many metrics to evaluate licensees&#8217; safety performance. This report uses a subset of these which &#8211; when taken together &#8211; have been determined to provide a well-rounded picture of performance for the licensees covered by this report. The metrics used in this report are:</p>  <ul>  <li>compliance performance</li>  <li>enforcement actions</li>  <li>doses to workers</li>  <li>reported events</li>  </ul>  <p>CNSC staff use a well-established Safety and Control Area Framework in evaluating each licensee&#8217;s safety performance. The framework includes 14&nbsp;safety and control areas (SCAs) covering all technical areas of regulatory oversight. While CNSC staff review and assess performance in each SCA (if applicable), only those that are most useful in providing a good overall indication of the safety performance of the licensees are covered in the ROR, as explained below.</p>  <p>For Part I, the ROR will cover SCA ratings for management system, operating performance, radiation protection, and security. In addition, it will provide the Commission information about the effort on the part of CNSC to regulate these licensees, along with stakeholder engagement.</p>  <p>For Part II, the ROR will include ratings for all 14 SCAs and will focus on management system, radiation protection, and conventional health and safety SCAs for both TRIUMF and the Canadian Light Source for calendar years 2018 and 2019. Part II will also discuss CNSC's regulatory oversight and the facilities' public information and disclosure programs.</p>  <p>For both parts of the ROR, the main body of the report is meant to provide a high-level overview of the CNSC&#8217;s regulatory efforts, along with the licensees&#8217; performance. The detailed data to support this overview can be found in the appendices: appendices A to F cover data linked to Part I of this report; appendices G to L link to Part II; and appendices M to P provide generic information applicable to both.</p>  <h2 id="secI">Part I: Use of Nuclear Substances in Canada: 2019</h2>  <p>The Regulatory Oversight Report on the Use of Nuclear Substances in Canada: 2019 summarizes the safety performance of 1,494 licensees, which hold a total of 2,090 licences. Additional data on licensees is available in <a href="#appx-A">Appendix A</a>. The CNSC authorizes these licensees to use nuclear substances and prescribed equipment in the medical, industrial, academic and research, and commercial sectors. Waste nuclear substance licences are included within the commercial sector. Section 4 of the <a href="/eng/resources/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2018/">2018 ROR</a> describes the sectors covered in this report.</p>  <p>For the purpose of Part I, CNSC staff evaluate safety performance by presenting licensees&#8217; regulatory compliance in select Safety and Control Areas (SCAs) (that is, management system, operating performance, radiation protection and security), as well as enforcement actions, effective doses to workers and reported events.</p>  <p>In 2019, as part of the ongoing regulatory oversight of licensees, CNSC staff conducted compliance verification activities consisting of field inspections, desktop reviews and technical assessments of licensee activities. The evaluations of findings for the SCAs covered in Part I show that, overall, licensees made acceptable provision to protect health, safety, security, and the environment from the use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment, and took the measures required to implement Canada&#8217;s international obligations. Based on these evaluations, CNSC staff conclude that the use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment in Canada remains safe and secure.</p>  <h3 id="secI-1">I.1 Compliance Performance</h3>  <p>During licensing and compliance activities, CNSC staff review the licensee&#8217;s (or applicant&#8217;s) performance within each relevant SCA by reviewing licensee documents and conducting inspections. Owing to the broad nature of the different activities conducted by the licensees covered in Part I, not all SCAs apply to all activities or all licensees. Although not incorporated into Part I, all relevant SCAs are assessed during compliance inspections and reviews of licensees&#8217; documents, and a compliance rating is assigned for each SCA. Each SCA covers multiple items: some of these are administrative in nature and are considered relatively low risk, while others are linked to an immediate risk to health safety and security, and therefore any findings against these items during an inspection must be addressed immediately. Licensees are given a below expectation rating in an SCA if they are non-compliant in at least one item of an SCA, regardless of the risk.</p>  <p>All required corrective actions arising from below-satisfactory performance are tracked and followed up by CNSC staff to ensure that all items of non-compliance are addressed to the satisfaction of the CNSC. For any instances of non-compliance that pose immediate risk to health, safety and security enhanced enforcement actions, such as orders or Administrative Monetary Penalties, may be taken.</p>  <p>In Part I, the performance of a subset of the SCAs evaluated during inspections is reviewed and reported. The following four SCAs are the most relevant indicators of safety performance for licensees in the sectors covered in Part I: management system, operating performance, radiation protection and security. These SCAs are applicable to most of the licensees covered by Part I and, together, provide an indication of licensees&#8217; overall safety performance. <a href="#appx-M">Appendix M</a> provides a description of the rating framework.</p>  <p>In 2019, CNSC staff conducted 863 inspections across the four sectors. Overall, licensees showed satisfactory compliance ratings in all of the SCAs examined in Part I. A list of inspections performed in 2019 is available in <a href="#appx-F">Appendix F</a>.  Where items of non-compliance were identified, CNSC staff ensured that licensees took appropriate corrective actions. Licensees immediately addressed any items of non-compliance that had immediate risks to health, safety or security.</p>  <h4 id="secI-1-1">I.1.1 Management System</h4>  <p>In 2019, licensees continued to maintain strong performance in the management system SCA. Overall, 97% of the licensees inspected received ratings of fully satisfactory or satisfactory for this SCA).  The management system SCA has been performing with similar results over the past few years.</p>  <p>Refer to <a href="#appx-B-1">Appendix B.1</a> for additional information.</p>  <h4 id="secI-1-2">I.1.2 Operating Performance</h4>  <p>In 2019, licensees&#8217; performance in the operating performance SCA improved from previous years. This is a reversal from the previous years that showed a slow decline. Of the licensees inspected, 86% received ratings of fully satisfactory or satisfactory for this SCA.</p>  <p>The only decline was in the commercial sector, although the overall results for this sector are still at 89% fully compliant. For context, this means  four of the 36 licensees inspected in the commercial sector had a non-compliance in this SCA, none of which were a concern. In creating its inspection plan for 2019, DNSR prioritized its most overdue medium risk licensees over well performing high risk licensees. Because of this approach, a reduction in performance in the medium risk use types, including those in the commercial sector, was expected.  This is the first year a decline in this sector was observed; this will be evaluated in upcoming years to see if this decline is a trend or single occurrence.</p>  <p>Refer to <a href="#appx-B-2">Appendix B.2</a> for additional information.</p>  <h4 id="secI-1-3">I.1.3 Radiation Protection</h4>  <p>Licensee&#8217;s overall performance in the radiation protection SCA declined in 2019, with 80% of licensees receiving ratings of fully satisfactory or satisfactory. The decreases were all medium risk licensees.</p>  <p>As with the operating performance SCA, the increase in the number of licensees with below expectations ratings in the radiation protection SCA may be due to prioritizing medium risk licensees that were overdue for inspection, particularly within the medical sector and the industrial sector, especially portable gauge licensees. The focus was on licensees that had not been inspected in the last five years, licensees with a poor compliance history and new licensees that had not been inspected. This focus provides a possible rationale for the observed decline in performance across this SCA. In addition, there was an increased focus from the CNSC inspectors to look at the licensee&#8217;s implementation of the radiation protection program and management oversight of their operational activities, especially for licensees that have not been inspected for some time.   This may also have contributed to the increased number of non-compliances in that area and, therefore, contributed to the overall decline in performance across this SCA. Both the medical licensees and the portable gauge licensees were highlighted in the case studies provided in the <a href="/eng/resources/publications/reports/use-of-nuclear-substances/2018/">2018 ROR</a>. The regulatory strategy described in those case studies was to target these licensees using a performance-based inspection, observing workers performing their duties. This inspection approach has improved detection of common areas of non-compliance, which is another possible explanation for the perceived decline in performance in this SCA.</p>  <p>The performance of the radiation protection SCA will continue to be monitored in order to determine if additional actions are required. The inspection frequency for medium risk licensees is every two to five years so it may take a few years before improvement is noticed on subsequent inspections.</p>  <p>Refer to <a href="#appx-B-3">Appendix B.3</a> for additional information.</p>  <h4 id="secI-1-4">I.1.4 Security</h4>  <p>In the security SCA, 95% of the licensees inspected demonstrated that they have adequate provisions in place to prevent the loss, sabotage, illegal use, illegal possession or illegal removal of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment in their care and control. This SCA performance is up almost 5% in 2019 from the 2018 and 2017 results. The 2019 results are trending at similar levels to 2015 and 2016. This is in keeping with the analysis in the 2018 ROR, which predicted a temporary period of lower performance as licensees adjusted to the new security requirements in REGDOC-2.13.2.</p>  <p>Refer to <a href="#appx-B-4">Appendix B.4</a> for additional information.</p>  <h3 id="secI-2">I.2 Enforcement</h3>  <p>The CNSC uses a graduated approach to enforcement to encourage compliance. When non-compliance (or continued non-compliance) has been identified, CNSC staff assess the significance of the non-compliance and determine the appropriate enforcement action.</p>  <p>In 2019, the CNSC initiated 13 escalated enforcement actions against licensees in the four sectors. There were no administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) issued in 2019. Most of the enforcement actions were taken against licensees in the industrial sector, consistent with trends from previous years. Out of 13 enforcement actions, 10 are closed as of the drafting of this ROR, meaning the CNSC is satisfied that the licensee has addressed the conditions of the order. Any  high risk or immediate health and safety findings were immediately addressed. In three cases, licensees that received orders have yet to comply with the terms and conditions of their orders and the orders remain open. The CNSC is actively working with the licensees in these orders to ensure that order requirements are addressed. Refer to <a href="#appx-C">Appendix C</a> for further details on enforcement actions taken in 2019.</p>  <h3 id="secI-3">I.3 Effective Doses to Workers</h3>  <p>Licensees are required to keep radiation doses to persons below regulatory limits and ALARA in accordance with the radiation protection programs established under the CNSC licences.</p>  <p>In 2019, doses were monitored for 63,015 workers in the four sectors covered in Part I. Of those workers, 26,539 were classified as nuclear energy workers (NEWs). The remaining 36,476 were not classified as NEWs and are referred to as non-NEWs in the report. Exposures to radiation continued to be very low for workers in 2019, consistent with previous reporting years. Additional information on effective doses to workers is in <a href="#appx-D">Appendix D</a>.</p>  <p>In 2019, one NEW received a whole body dose above the regulatory limit of 50 mSv. The CNSC was notified that a worker received a dose of 57 mSv in November 2019. CNSC staff presented information on this event at the Commission hearing in June 2020. More information on this event can be found in <a href="#appx-E">Appendix E.</a></p>  <p>One non-NEW received a whole body dose above the regulatory limit of 1 mSv.  More information on this event can be found in <a href="#appx-E">Appendix E.</a></p>  <p>In both of these cases, the doses received do not pose a risk of radiation-related health effects.</p>  <h3 id="secI-4">I.4 Reported Events</h3>  <p>CNSC staff assessed the 183 events<sup id="fnb1-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> reported by licensees covered in Part I. Reported events have been ranked using the <a href="/eng/resources/emergency-management-and-safety/ines-classification">International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES)</a>. Of these, 181 were ranked as level&nbsp;0 (no safety significance), one was ranked as level&nbsp;1 (anomaly) and one was ranked as level&nbsp;2 (incident). These are the same events described in the previous section on Effective Doses to workers. The INES level 1 event is the non-NEW that received a whole body dose above the regulatory limit of 1 mSv. The INES level 2 event is the event where the NEW received a whole body dose above the regulatory limit of 50 mSv. Refer to <a href="#appx-E">Appendix E</a> for the list of reported events.</p>  <p>For all of the events reported, licensees implemented appropriate response measures to mitigate the impacts of the events and to limit radiation exposure to workers and the public. CNSC staff reviewed the measures and found them to be satisfactory.</p>  <h3 id="secI-5">I.5 Case Studies in Regulatory Intervention</h3>  <p>CNSC staff monitor the performance of licensees across all sectors, using various metrics. When<br/>
these metrics indicate that the performance is not meeting expectations, or is declining, CNSC staff develop regulatory strategies to address the situation. Once the strategies have been implemented, CNSC staff monitor their effectiveness and adjust them if necessary.</p>  <p>Two case studies on licensees from the commercial sector are presented in this ROR. The first is a case study on an Iodine-131 (I-131) Processing licensee, Isologic Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals Ltd. (IIR), and the second is on a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) isotope cyclotron and associated processing laboratories, Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. The case studies are not intended to be punitive, they are intended to demonstrate lessons learned from a regulatory oversight perspective and actions taken by licensees that resulted in improvements in their programs. These lessons could be implemented by other licensees.</p>  <h4 id="secI-5-1">I.5.1 I-131 Processing Facility</h4>  <h5 id="secI-5-1-1">I.5.1.1 Introduction</h5>  <p>I-131 is a radioisotope that has been used in the Nuclear Medicine industry for decades.  It is used to diagnose and treat thyroid disorders, as well as to diagnose certain neuroendocrine tumours in both adults and children.  I-131 is also used in veterinary medicine, particularly for the treatment of feline hyperthyroidism.</p>  <p>Production of I-131 radiopharmaceuticals is considered a high risk activity due to the volatile nature of iodine.  Airborne I-131 is easily concentrated in the thyroid, so appropriate containment measures must be used.  Due to this high risk nature, there are only a small number of radiopharmaceutical processing facilities in Canada.  This case study looks at the decline in safety performance at one such facility, Isologic Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals Ltd. (IIR), and CNSC staff&#8217;s subsequent increase in regulatory oversight, thereby ensuring the protection of the public and the environment.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-1-2">I.5.1.2 Background</h5>  <p>This licensee has been expanding its operations in Canada for some years. In a short length of time, they increased the number of licensed locations under their processing licence from one location to seven and introduced the manufacturing of I-131 capsules to the services that they provide to their customers.</p>  <p>Over the course of a four-year period, from 2014 to 2018, CNSC staff observed a significant decline in safety performance, which began with the licensee reporting to the CNSC a series of events in 2014 involving contaminated packages that were delivered to multiple hospitals. In reviewing these events, CNSC staff concluded that, although these incidents were of minor safety significance due to the relatively low levels of contamination involved, the licensee did not have sufficient management oversight of their work practices. The RSO at the time committed to improve the management oversight practices within their organization.</p>  <p>In February 2017, CNSC staff conducted a Type I inspection of the licensee&#8217;s operations, which span locations across Canada; the results of this inspection demonstrated a further decline in performance. The concerns were related to the licensee&#8217;s management oversight of the radiation protection program, more specifically towards the I-131 manufacturing operations.  The CNSC performed two follow-up inspections in May and October 2017. The licensee worked through the implementation of the corrective actions following these inspections.</p>  <p>In the fall of 2018, the licensee reported to the CNSC two events at one of their locations. The first occurred in November, when a nuclear energy worker (NEW) exceeded the equivalent dose limit to the skin of the hand while conducting therapeutic I-131 capsule production. A few days after the event, CNSC staff conducted an inspection at the licensee&#8217;s location. The inspection found several non-compliances with regulatory requirements, which included workers routinely not following procedures relevant to I-131 processing and personnel monitoring. In addition, CNSC staff concluded that the responsibilities for implementation and oversight of the Radiation Protection Program were not clearly understood and executed by licensee staff. The licensee reported the second event one month later, indicating that they had exceeded their quarterly and annual airborne release limits for I-131. CNSC staff presented the reported events and inspection findings to the Commission in <a href="/eng/the-commission/meetings/cmd/pdf/CMD18/CMD18-M65.pdf">CMD 18-M65</a> as an Event Initial Report on December 13, 2018. Six days later, a CNSC Designated Officer (DO) issued an order to the licensee to immediately cease all processing of I-131 until such time that actions are taken to train staff, conduct a root cause analysis on I-131 releases and establish a program to monitor workers&#8217; adherence to procedures.  In addition, the order required the licensee to immediately make provisions to ensure adequate supply of I-131 radiopharmaceutical products to Canadian patients throughout the time period of suspended processing. CNSC staff reported this DO order to the Commission and continued to provide updates to the Commission on several occasion in the 14 months that followed the issuance of the Order.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conducted two additional compliance inspections in 2019; based on the results of these inspections, CNSC staff determined that the licensee had met all the terms and conditions of the Order. As previously reported to the Commission, the Order was closed on January 7, 2020.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-1-3">I.5.1.3 Regulatory Approach</h5>  <p>The standard CNSC approach to regulatory oversight for licensees using nuclear substances and prescribed equipment focuses on regulating similar activities across multiple licensees. However, in the case of Isologic, which is the biggest provider of I-131 to the medical sector in Canada, CNSC staff recognized that due to the size of its operations, this licensee required a tailored regulatory oversight strategy.</p>  <p>In addressing the situation described through this case study, the CNSC took a much more active role in the review of the licensee&#8217;s procedures than is typically required with this type of licensee. The goal of CNSC staff was to assist the licensee to significantly improve their programs to prevent reoccurrence of similar events moving forward. The regulatory approach included regular progress meetings with the licensee, as well as a detailed review and oversight of the environmental protection program. CNSC staff used the expert knowledge of subject matter specialists including staff from radiation protection, environmental protection, licensing, and compliance, to review the licensee&#8217;s submissions and to provide recommendations to the licensee. The licensee implemented a number of corrective actions, which the CNSC closely monitored through a phased approval process with regulatory hold points.</p>  <p>In the end, this team-based approach determined that the licensee&#8217;s submissions addressed the causes of the non-compliances that resulted in the issuance of the DO Order, and that the restart of I-131 operations would continue to protect the environment, the health and safety of workers, and the public.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-1-4">I.5.1.4 Conclusion</h5>  <p>At this time, the licensee remains fully compliant in their I-131 operations and continues to work closely with the CNSC to implement continuing improvements to their management system within their organization. The CNSC is planning a further compliance inspection of this licensee before the end of 2020 to verify the implementation of additional commitments that have been made.</p>  <h4 id="secI-5-2">I.5.2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Isotope Cyclotron Facility</h4>  <h5 id="secI-5-2-1">I.5.2.1 Introduction</h5>  <p>Isotope production accelerators such as cyclotrons produce isotopes used in the synthesis of nuclear medicine radiopharamaceuticals, used primarily for nuclear medicine imaging.  Isotope production licensees may produce isotopes for both clinical and research purposes.</p>  <p>The licensee examined in this case study, the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, has been running a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) isotope cyclotron and associated processing laboratories for almost three decades.  There are two laboratories in the facility: one to handle clinical production of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radiopharmaceutical used in medical imaging, in a fully automated manner inside shielded cells (hotcells); the second is for making various isotopes and tracers used for research in a nearby hospital.</p>  <p>At this facility, processing isotopes in the research lab is not fully automated. While most of the processing is done automatically, certain steps involve handling of vials or syringes inside the hotcells. This is because the hotcells are not equipped with robotic arms or remote handling manipulators.  This means workers use their hands in the process to handle vials or other samples through small arm doors in the hotcell front shielding.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-2-2">I.5.2.2 Background</h5>  <p>Action levels are intended to provide an early indication of a possible loss of control of part of a licensee&#8217;s radiation protection program.  In January and February of 2017, the licensee reported to CNSC staff that the monthly extremity dose action levels of 450 mSv/y (extrapolated monthly) were exceeded for personnel processing radioisotopes. As this dose level was still below the regulatory equivalent dose limit of 500mSv/y, the licensee was still compliant with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations.</em></p>  <p>As part of routine regulatory oversight, CNSC staff performed a benchmark analysis of worker doses as a function of the annual production for 17 isotope production cyclotron licensees in Canada.  The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate licensee performance in this sector by normalizing dose based on total production at the facility and the number of workers, taking into account the nature of the operation: research vs commercial production.  The benchmarking analysis showed that this particular licensee&#8217;s workers received the highest extremity annual doses normalized to the facility annual production compared to similar licensees.</p>  <p>Prompted by these two indicators, CNSC staff decided to take additional actions, starting with enhanced monitoring of the licensee. An October 2017 inspection revealed that the licensee had made little progress toward reducing the collective extremity dose.  CNSC staff requested that the licensee review all radiochemistry processes and begin monthly reporting outlining their progress toward the goal of reducing extremity doses.</p>  <p>The licensee complied with the CNSC staff request and subsequently committed to two improvements to help reduce extremity doses: namely, using special tools to increase the distance between the source and the fingers, and semi-automating certain setups to reduce handling.  A follow up inspection in March 2019 indicated that the licensee was not following its own internal procedures.</p>  <p>In order to mitigate the risk of continued high extremity doses, a CNSC inspector issued an order to the licensee to prohibit any handling inside the hotcell of activity in excess of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) until the licensee submitted adequate processes for minimizing worker doses.  CNSC staff ultimately determined that the licensee had met all the terms and conditions of the Order, and the Order was subsequently closed on November 5, 2019.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-2-3">I.5.2.3 Regulatory Approach</h5>  <p>In addition to assessing licensee performance through standard compliance activities, such as conducting inspections and reviewing annual compliance reports, CNSC staff also monitor other indicators that help to flag possible areas of concern. In this case, a review of events reported by this licensee, combined with a benchmarking analysis of worker doses, led CNSC staff to increase its regulatory oversight of this licensee through the application of a number of compliance tools, applied in an escalated manner. As a result of these regulatory actions, the licensee improved its performance with respect to radiation safety.</p>  <h5 id="secI-5-2-4">I.5.2.4 Conclusion</h5>  <p>The licensee has demonstrated a clear reduction of extremity doses: the maximum yearly extremity doses decreased from 348 mSv in 2018 to 196 mSv in 2019.  CNSC staff continue to monitor licensee performance through a combination of desktop compliance verification and on-site inspections to ensure sustained good performance.</p>  <h3 id="secI-6">I.6 Stakeholder Engagement</h3>  <p>Nuclear substance licensees are not required to have public information disclosure programs (unlike the Class IB Accelerator licensees covered in Part II of this report). Stakeholder engagement and outreach activities are performed by the CNSC to facilitate communication on licenced activities and regulatory expectations between the CNSC, nuclear substance licensees, the public, and Indigenous communities.</p>  <p>Stakeholder engagement and outreach are critical elements of the CNSC&#8217;s regulatory approach. Given the breadth of licensees regulated in the area of nuclear substances, a particular focus is on reaching and engaging with licensee communities, which leads to increased awareness and better understanding of the regulatory process and requirements. CNSC staff leverage a variety of fora to engage with licensees and promote the use of the tools that are developed to support their compliance with regulatory expectations. Inspections are a particularly valuable opportunity to engage directly with licensees.</p>  <p>CNSC outreach in 2019 included:</p>  <ul>
<li>Annual meetings with the radiography industry: The CNSC holds two separate annual meetings with the radiography industry. In 2019 the meetings were held in Ottawa, Ontario on May 8<sup>th</sup> and Nisku, Alberta on May 23rd. CNSC staff use these meetings to address recent and upcoming regulatory developments and discuss other areas of regulatory focus.</li>
<li>Newsletter: One issue of the DNSR Newsletter was published in the summer of 2019.</li>
<li>Working Groups:
<ul>
<li>There were two meetings with the Industrial Radiography working group one in February and one in October 2019. The working group meets to discuss best practices and safety performance, and provides a forum in which stakeholders can stay informed of new developments from both technical and regulatory perspectives.</li>
<li>There was also a meeting with the CRPA working group during the CRPA conference in May 2019. Topics for such meetings are varied, focusing on items of mutual interest, and are intended to foster open communications between CRPA and the CNSC. Topics have included: multi modality dose consideration in room approvals, designation of workers as NEWS without dose justification, discussion of upcoming regulatory documents and changes to the disposal table on licence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Industry meetings: CNSC staff met with the Canadian Council of Independent Laboratories in May 2019. CNSC Staff presented on trends in the portable gauge industry.</li>
<li>Meetings with Indigenous groups: CNSC staff participated in Indigenous engagement outreach in Ontario and New Brunswick.</li>
<li>Participation in CRPA meeting: CNSC staff delivered presentations at the Canadian Radiation Protection Association&#8217;s annual meeting in May 2019.</li>
<li>Presentation to school students: CNSC staff participated in a STEM talk with students at a local Ottawa school, organized by Accelerator and Class II Facilities Division staff.</li>
<li>Participation in COMP meeting: CNSC staff presented at the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists annual scientific meeting in September 2019.</li>
<li>Town Hall: CNSC staff held a virtual town hall meeting for Accelerator and Class II Facilities licensees. The Class II regulations were under review and changes to these regulations were discussed. There were 58 participants in this meeting.</li>  </ul>  <h3 id="secI-7">I.7 Conclusion</h3>  <p>In 2019, the majority of the inspected licensees were in compliance with the expectations of the SCAs in this report. Most of the enforcement actions taken in 2019 have been closed with the CNSC closely monitoring the three orders that are still open. Exposure to workers in 2019 continue to be very low and consistent with previous years. For the events reported in 2019, the licensees implemented appropriate responses to address the events, as determined by CNSC staff. CNSC staff continue to host outreach with various stakeholders to keep the public, Indigenous communities and licensees informed.</p>  <p>Through the case studies highlighted in this report the CNSC was able to improve compliance by helping licensees to focus on the right corrective actions to improve their performance.</p>  <p>Based on the CNSC&#8217;s comprehensive regulatory oversight of the industry, CNSC staff conclude that the use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment in Canada is safe. Licensees corrected identified items of non-compliance to the satisfaction of CNSC staff; adequate provisions are in place to protect the health, safety and security of persons and the environment from the use of nuclear substances and prescribed equipment.</p>  <h2 id="secII">Part II: Class IB Accelerators in Canada: 2018-2019</h2>  <p>The DNSR ROR: Part II presents the operating performance of the two Class IB accelerator facilities regulated by CNSC: the Tri University Meson Facility (TRIUMF) and the Canadian Light Source Inc. (CLSI).</p>  <p><a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">TRIUMF</a> operates one 520 megaelectronvolt (MeV) cyclotron accelerator facility, four smaller cyclotrons facilities, and three linear accelerator facilities. TRIUMF is located on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver, British Columbia. TRIUMF is a nuclear and particle physics research centre and is a major producer of radioisotopes used for medical diagnostic procedures. The 520-Mev cyclotron accelerator has been in operation since 1975.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.lightsource.ca/">CLSI</a> operates a synchrotron facility, on the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The facility produces synchrotron radiation that is used as a light source for experiments in diverse fields. The facility has been in operation since 2005.</p>  <p>Public concern tends to be low regarding the safety performance of Class IB accelerator facilities. Since CNSC staff have been reporting the safety performance for the facilities it regulated (starting in 2013) the consultation process for the Class 1B accelerator ROR has never yielded comments from the public nor requests for participation at the Commission meetings. Therefore, the ROR on Class IB accelerators in Canada has been presented every second year since 2016.</p>  <h3 id="secII-1">II.1 Compliance Performance</h3>  <p>The main hazards associated with Class IB accelerator facilities are radiological exposure and conventional industrial hazards. Nuclear substances are present as a result of deliberate irradiation of targets designed to produce desired isotopes, or as an unavoidable by-product generated in irradiated air or accelerator components. Consequently, TRIUMF&#39;s environmental releases are very small and CLSI has no radioactive environmental releases resulting from the operation of the synchrotron.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conducted consistent and risk-informed regulatory oversight at the Class IB particle accelerator facilities. Table 20 of <a href="#appx-G">Appendix G</a> presents the licensing and compliance efforts from CNSC staff for the Class IB accelerator facilities for 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>During this two-year period, CNSC staff conducted six targeted onsite inspections, three at TRIUMF and three at CLSI. CNSC staff provided the findings from these inspections to the licensees in detailed inspection reports. Licensee corrective actions enacted in response to Notices of Non Compliance identified by CNSC staff are followed through to resolution.</p>  <p>These facilities are required, as part of their operating licences, to submit an annual compliance report (ACR) by June 30 each year. The review of these ACRs by CNSC subject matter experts complements the compliance inspections and provides verification of licensee performance on an annual basis.</p>  <p>In comparison with previous years, regulatory efforts increased slightly in 2018 and 2019. This was primarily due to increased assessment efforts in response to necessary changes for both facilities in order to implement CSA Standard N286-12, <em>Management System Requirements for Nuclear Facilities</em>, which came out in 2012. Compliance with this standard was required starting January 2018 for TRIUMF and CLSI. This is discussed further in the Management System section below.</p>  <p>CNSC staff use the SCA framework in evaluating each licensee's safety performance level. Each SCA is rated through compliance inspections, desktop reviews of events and incidents, and ACR review. These ratings are used as an indicator of performance and potential areas requiring attention from the licensee and CNSC staff. Compliance oversight plans are developed by CNSC staff, taking into consideration a number of factors, including these ratings. A facility performing below the satisfactory level in any of the SCAs will be subject to escalated enforcement by CNSC staff until the situation is remedied.</p>  <p>For calendar years 2018 and 2019, the performance in all 14 SCAs for TRIUMF was rated as satisfactory or better, with the exception of the Management System SCA (as discussed in section II.1.1.1).  For the same time period, CLSI&#8217;s performance was rated satisfactory or better in all SCAs, with the exception of the Management System SCA in 2019 (as discussed in section II.1.1.2). <a href="#appx-H">Appendix H</a> provides the SCA ratings for the past five years for TRIUMF (Table 14) and CLSI (Table 15).</p>  <h4 id="secII-1-1">II.1.1 Management System</h4>  <p>The Management System SCA covers the framework which establishes the processes and programs required to ensure an organization achieves its safety objectives and continuously monitors its performance against these objectives and fostering a healthy safety culture.</p>  <p>Since January 2018, Class IB accelerator facilities are required to comply to CSA Standard N286-12, <em>Management System Requirements for Nuclear Facilities</em>, as stated in the licence condition handbook.</p>  <h5 id="secII-1-1-1">II.1.1.1 TRIUMF</h5>  <p>In February 2016, CNSC staff carried out a management system inspection at TRIUMF. TRIUMF took corrective actions to address the findings from that inspection to CNSC satisfaction. Following the inspection, TRIUMF committed to comply with CSA Standard N286-12 by January 2018. However, it took longer than expected for TRIUMF to perform a gap analysis of their management system against N286-12 and therefore TRIUMF did not meet the deadline. TRIUMF decided to increase resources committed to this task and spent most of 2019 looking for a suitable quality assurance (QA) manager responsible for coordinating these compliance efforts. CNSC staff delayed the February 2019 management system inspection due to TRIUMF's lack of progress on performing the gap analysis and closing the gaps. In December 2019, TRIUMF hired a new QA manager. In March 2020, TRIUMF's new QA manager submitted a gap analysis report to CNSC staff. CNSC staff reviewed the gap analysis and focussed communications between the new QA manager and CNSC management specialists have now put TRIUMF on the right track to demonstrate that they will meet N286-12 requirements by the end of 2020. CNSC staff rescheduled the February 2019 management system inspection for the fall of 2020.</p>  <p>TRIUMF operates under an effective management system, which allows them to perform their licenced activities safely. However, CNSC staff rated TRIUMF below expectations for the Management System SCA for both 2018 and 2019 because TRIUMF failed to demonstrate compliance to CSA Standard N286-12. TRIUMF&#8217;s gap analysis of their management system against the standard may result in opportunities for improvements that will increase the defence in depth, resulting in increased safety.  The delay does not pose an immediate risk to health and safety.</p>  <h5 id="secII-1-1-2">II.1.1.2 CLSI</h5>  <p>CLSI performed a gap analysis of their management system against the N286-12 standard and updated their procedures accordingly in order to meet the January 2018 compliance date. Upon initial review of their revised management system program, CNSC staff determined that CLSI was compliant. Subsequently, CLSI underwent a management system inspection in July 2019, focused on N286-12 implementation. CNSC staff noted that CLSI had made some progress in their management system. However, it was also noted that CLSI was not complying with its own governance and the problem identification and resolution process was found to be non-compliant with N286-12 requirements.</p>  <p>CNSC staff concluded that CLSI is partially meeting the N286-12 requirements. Despite these non-compliances, CLSI has an effective management system and continues to safely operate the Class IB facility. Further compliance activities are planned in 2020 in order to follow up with the deficiencies flagged and ensure that CLSI is in full compliance with N286-12. As a result, CLSI has been rated as below expectations for the Management System SCA for 2019.</p>  <h4 id="secII-1-2">II.1.2 Radiation Protection</h4>  <p>The Radiation Protection SCA covers the implementation of a radiation protection program in accordance with the <em>Radiation Protection Regulations</em>. The program must ensure that contamination levels and radiation doses received by individuals are monitored, controlled and maintained ALARA.</p>  <p>The rating for the Radiation Protection SCA for both Class IB accelerator facilities was satisfactory or better, which is unchanged from the previous three years. The ratings for the past five years are presented in <a href="#appx-H">Appendix H</a>.</p>  <p>During 2018 and 2019, CNSC staff determined that all Class IB accelerator facilities implemented effective measures to keep radiation exposures and doses to persons ALARA. This has consistently resulted in doses to persons being well below CNSC regulatory dose limits.</p>  <p>All Class IB accelerator facilities continued to comply with the regulatory requirements to measure and record doses received by workers. Details are provided in section II.3 below.</p>  <p>Both TRIUMF and CLSI have put in place dose action levels that, if reached, may indicate a loss of control of part of their radiation protection program. In 2018 and 2019, there were no occurrences of dose exceeding action levels at either facility.</p>  <p>Both TRIUMF and CLSI have put in place comprehensive radiation dose area monitoring programs and surface contamination monitoring and mitigation programs. CNSC staff routinely verify the results and compare them to previous years&#8217; results. No anomalies were noted in 2018 or 2019.</p>  <p>Doses to members of the public from the Class IB facilities has been consistently well below the CNSC regulatory dose limit for a member of the public of 1 mSv/year. For TRIUMF, the public dose trend for the last five year is presented in Table 23 of <a href="#appx-I">Appendix I</a>. There are no airborne or liquid effluent releases of nuclear substances from CLSI. Therefore, the estimated dose to the public is at natural radiation background levels for this facility.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conclude that for 2018 and 2019, the Class IB accelerator facilities effectively maintained their radiation protection programs to ensure the health and safety of persons present in their facilities.</p>  <h4 id="secII-1-3">II.1.3 Conventional Health and Safety</h4>  <p>The Conventional Health and Safety SCA covers the implementation of a program to manage workplace safety hazards and to protect personnel and equipment.</p>  <p>CNSC's risk-informed analysis of both Class IB particle accelerator facilities concluded that conventional health and safety is the only SCA for which both the probability of an accident is high and the impact is high. Therefore, the frequency of inspection of this SCA is the highest for all SCAs, with an interval of one to two years for TRIUMF and two to three years for CLSI. CNSC staff verified conventional health and safety at TRIUMF during the April 2018 inspection and again during the April 2019 inspection. CLSI's last conventional health and safety inspection was in 2017.</p>  <p>A key performance indicator for the conventional health and safety SCA is the lost-time injury rate. The lost-time injury rate is presented in Table 24 of <a href="#appx-J">Appendix J</a> for the last five years, along with a description of all lost-time injuries for 2018 and 2019 in Table 18 of the same appendix.</p>  <p>The rating for the conventional health and safety SCA was satisfactory or better for both Class IB accelerator facilities in 2018-2019.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conclude that for 2018 and 2019, the Class IB accelerator facilities effectively maintained their conventional health and safety programs to ensure the health and safety of persons present in their facilities.</p>  <h3 id="secII-2">II.2 Enforcement</h3>  <p>The CNSC uses a graduated approach to enforcement to encourage compliance. When non-compliance (or continued non-compliance) has been identified, CNSC staff assess the significance of the non-compliance and determine the appropriate enforcement action.</p>  <p>In 2018 and 2019, neither TRIUMF nor CLSI had enforcement actions.</p>  <h3 id="secII-3">II.3 Effective Doses to Workers</h3>  <p>All Class IB accelerator facilities continued to comply with the regulatory requirements to measure and record doses received by workers. During 2018 and 2019, all Class IB accelerator facilities monitored and controlled the radiation exposures and doses received by all persons present at their licensed facilities, including workers, contractors and visitors. Figure 18 and 19 of <a href="#appx-K">Appendix K</a> provides the effective doses to nuclear energy workers for Class IB accelerator facilities for this reporting period.</p>  <h3 id="secII-4">II.4 Reported Events</h3>  <p>For 2018-2019, TRIUMF had 11 events<sup id="fnb2-ref"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fnb2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> and CLSI had six events. <a href="#appx-L">Appendix L</a> describes these events in detail. For each event reported, the licensees performed an internal investigation and implemented corrective actions to prevent reoccurrences. Both facilities reported these events to CNSC as required by the regulations or the licence conditions. In each case, CNSC staff reviewed the report and corrective actions and found them to be satisfactory.</p>  <h3 id="secII-5">II.5 Public Information and Disclosure Program</h3>  <p>Class IB accelerator facilities have a responsibility to inform the public about their nuclear facilities and activities. CNSC staff recognize that Class IB accelerators are low-risk facilities and that a full-scale public information program, as undertaken by larger nuclear facilities, is not warranted. However, the CNSC requires these licensees to provide open and transparent information to the public. The objective is to ensure that timely information about the health, safety and security of persons and the environment and other issues associated with the nuclear facility are effectively communicated.</p>  <p>The public information and disclosure program was established in December 2018 for TRIUMF and in September 2018 for CLSI.</p>  <p>CNSC staff verified through annual compliance reporting that public information and disclosure programs were being implemented satisfactorily during 2018-2019.  The CNSC has provided feedback on their communications programs to CLSI and TRIUMF, including areas for improvement to ensure that the programs remain effective at communicating useful information about the health, safety and security of persons and the environment and other matters of public interest associated with these facilities.</p>  <h3 id="secII-6">II.6 Conclusion</h3>  <p>Through regulatory oversight activities, CNSC staff confirmed that Class IB Particle Accelerator facilities in Canada continued to operate safely in 2018 and 2019. The regulatory oversight activities included inspections, review of reports submitted by licensees, event and incident review with follow-up, general communication and exchanges of information with the licensees.</p>  <p>For the three SCAs presented in detail in this report, CNSC staff concluded that both the radiation program and the conventional health and safety program were satisfactory. However, the implementation of CSA Standard N286-12 into the management system of both Class IB accelerator facilities has been a challenge during the reporting period. As a result, CNSC staff has increased their regulatory efforts to bring both facilities closer to full compliance with the standard.</p>  <p>CNSC staff conclude that for the reporting period, both TRIUMF and CLS made adequate provision for the health and safety of workers, the protection of the public and the environment, as well as Canada's international obligations.</p>  <p>Appendices A to F cover data linked to Part I of this report; appendices G to L link to Part II; and appendices M to P provide generic information applicable to both.</p>  <h2 id="appx-A">Appendix A: Regulatory Program for the Use of Nuclear Substances</h2>  <p>This section presents additional regulatory data to complement the information provided in the main part of the document.</p>  <h3 id="appx-A-1">A.1 CNSC regulatory effort</h3>  <table class="table table-bordered">  <caption class="text-left">Table 1: Licensing and certification in 2019, all sectors combined</caption>

None of the injuries was directly related to the licensed activities.</p>  <p>In response to this increase in 2019, TRIUMF updated its pre-job hazard analysis and briefing form for work involving contractors. TRIUMF will roll out this form site-wide for non-contractor work in 2020.</p>  <p>WorkSafeBC, the provincial agency with the mandate to oversee a non-fault insurance system for the workplace in British Columbia, has assigned TRIUMF in the advanced research classification unit along with similar businesses in British Columbia, such as institutions which provide post-secondary education including university, college, business, computer, career training, trade, and vocational programs. For both 2018 and 2019, the average lost-time injury rate for the advanced research classification unit was 0.6 for 100 person-years. Therefore, TRIUMF lost-time injury rate was well below the average rate for the advanced research classification unit in 2018, but was at the average rate for 2019.</p>  <h3 id="appx-J-2">J.2 CLSI</h3>  <p>In 2018 and 2019, there was no lost-time injuries at CLSI.</p>  <table class="table table-bordered">  <caption class="text-left">Table 25: Lost-time injuries, TRIUMF, 2018-2019</caption>

As a result of this change, non-NEW employees, users and contractors are not required to wear personal dosimetry in the controlled access areas of the facility. Dose for these groups of people are be ascertained using a network of passive area radiation monitors in different areas of the facility. In 2019, the passive area radiation monitors in these areas of the building did not record a value that would have resulted in any dose to these individuals and thus are assigned no dose.</p>  <p>Effective doses at CLSI continue to be low and are following the same trend as previous years.</p>  <figure>  <figcaption>Figure 19: CLSI &#8211; Effective Doses of Nuclear Energy Workers, 2015 &#8211; 2019</figcaption>  <img alt="" src="/images/dnsr-ror-2019/fig-19-eng.png" class="img-responsive"/>  <details>  <summary>Figure 19: Text version</summary>  <table class="table table-bordered">

The contamination was restricted to the flask and no one was contaminated. Following decontamination of the external surfaces of the flasks by CNL personnel, they were returned to TRIUMF where further detailed analysis of the internal surfaces strongly suggested that the bottom of one of the 22.7 litre steel inner pails had been breached during transport. The suspected cause of the breach was mechanical fatigue induced by stresses from movement of the target inside the pail during transport.</p>  <p>The principal corrective action was to source a heavier-gauge steel pail that would be more resistant to the stresses. A controlled &quot;simulated road test&quot; was performed to assess the validity of both the presumed cause and the proposed corrective action by reproducing the vibrational stresses resulting from several thousand kilometers of road travel. The details and results of this test confirmed both the assumed cause and the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p>  <p><strong>February 15, 2018: Powdered target lithium hydride fire (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#10871)</strong></p>  <p>In 2018 a site-wide 5S initiative was undertaken to clean-up and remove surplus equipment and detectors that had accumulated from the last several decades of operation. 5S is a workplace organization method that stands for sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. During a focused 5S event in the Meson Flail, an unlabeled 1-litre size metal target canister, containing several hundred grams of reactive material (likely lithium hydride) was removed from the Meson Hall and placed in the metal recycling area on the south side. While there, the target window was accidentally punctured when a tool fell on it, dispersing a thin layer of powder on the supporting block and asphalt floor. Not realizing that it was a reactive metal, the worker placed the metal canister upright in an outdoor waste bin where it was exposed to moisture and started smoldering. Prompt action on the worker&#8217;s part in summoning assistance resulted in the fire being quickly extinguished. Vancouver Fire &amp; Rescue Services responded with their hazardous materials team.</p>  <p>A root cause analysis was completed that recommended a corrective action to document a safe work procedure for conducting a 5S event. The procedure includes steps for planning and conducting a 5S event that ensure hazards are assessed ahead of time and that safety personnel input is solicited in deciding on safe disposal of surplus material.</p>  <p><strong>October 9, 2018: Accidental release of carbon-11</strong></p>  <p>On October 9, 2018, there was an unplanned release of ~33 GBq of gaseous C-11, which occurred during the production of PET pharmaceuticals in a Life Sciences Division radioisotope library. The cause of the release was determined to have been &#8220;operator error&#8221; on the part of the chemist. Based on the wind direction over the time of the release, it was estimated that the maximum dose to a member of the public as a result of the lease would have been approximately 8.5 nSv. The impact to member of the general public corresponded to less than 1/100,000 of the regulatory limit. Changes were made to the procedure to minimize the likelihood of recurrence of such an error.</p>  <p><strong>October 19, 2018: 12.5 kV power line strike (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#11750)</strong></p>  <p>On October 19, 2018 a sub-contractor retained by WSP Environmental to complete environmental sampling work for the Institute for advanced Medical Isotopes (IAMI) project struck the buried 12.5 kV high voltage line that supplies power to the TRIUMF site. The workers were not injured. Owing to redundancies in the number of cables in the duct bank, connections were able to be reconfigured to use the undamaged cables, and power to the site was re-established within 30 hours. A full ramp up of machine operation took another three days. An investigation was done and found that the locating service contractor retained by WSP Environmental did not locate the concrete duct bank that runs between the substation immediately south of the perimeter fence to the site transformers. The investigation also revealed that the WSP engineer had not reviewed site services drawings even when making changes to hole locations late in the process, and they had not attended the site orientation session held earlier for IAMI contractors. The incident was immediately reported to regulatory authorities, WorkSafeBC, Technical Safety BC and the CNSC. TRIUMF put a moratorium on all ground disturbances until a review could be completed and new controls put in place.</p>  <p>The root causes identified the lack of formal TRIUMF procedures and controls for ground disturbance activities on site. This has been rectified with the implementation of a new Ground Disturbance Permit and associated Work Instruction: Ground Disturbance Procedure. The new proceduress require: use of up to date site utility drawings obtained from TRIUMF Service Group engineers; overlay of the proposed ground disturbances on the utility drawings; use of a contractor for locating underground utilities; and a final review by TRIUMF services engineers of the proposed ground disturbances with the located utilities to determine if further non-destructive techniques are required to expose existing utilities prior to excavation.</p>  <p><strong>January 8, 2019 and October 28, 2019: Accidental Releases of carbon-11 (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#12818)</strong></p>  <p>Two accidental releases of C-11 from Lab 005 during post-irradiation processing occurred, the first on January 8 (52 GBq) and the second on October 28 (15 GBq). Based on analyses of the release profiles that take into account the wind direction over the duration of the releases, the first release is estimated to have a maximum dose impact to a member of the public of 16 nSv, the second 3 nSv. Their combined impact to member of the general public corresponded to less than 1/50,000 of the regulatory limit. The cause of the first release was determined to be that the re-assembly of the apparatus following maintenance had not been sufficiently tight to prevent leakage from the trapping column. An additional step was added to the processing checklist to ensure that the apparatus was leak tight prior to commencing the process.</p>  <p>The cause of the second release was operator error: the chemist performing the process pushed the wrong btn on the control console, causing the activity to be released into the nuclear ventilation stack instead of the waste bag. The corrective actions included making hardware changes that would prevent the release of activity directly into the nuclear ventilation, as well as making changes to the colours and locations of control btns to reduce the likelihood of the same error recurring.</p>  <p><strong>January 24 to March 27, 2019: Accidental releases of xenon-123 and iodine-123 (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#12368)</strong></p>  <p>A leaky BWXT gas target resulted in the release of 98 GBq of Xe-123 and 170 MBq of I-123 during irradiations over a period of approximately two months. An additional release of 11 GBq of Xe-123 occurred during June 17-18 when the same target was used again following an extended maintenance period for the CP42. The releases were identified from observations of I-123 on the weekly nuclear exhaust stack sampling filters. The Xe-123 releases were subsequently identified in the logged air monitor data from their distinctive build-up curves. Corrective actions included training for RPG surveyors to recognize and report anomalous occurrences, as well as providing ATG Operators with information to allow them to identify and report anomalous air monitor readings that may indicate leaking targets but are below alarm threshold. Based on an analysis of the release profile that takes into account the wind direction over the duration of the releases, the releases are estimated to have a maximum dose impact to a member of the public of 21 nSv. The impact to member of the general public corresponded to less than 1/30,000 of the regulatory limit.</p>  <p><strong>May 28, 2019 and August 27. 2019: Accidental release of krypton-79, krypton-77 and bromine-77 (TRIUMF non-compliance reports NCR#12295 and NCR#12613)</strong></p>  <p>Although the original release in May (40 GBq Kr-79) was attributed to a leaky valve stem on the rubidium target canister, the proposed cause was never verified. Following the second release (194 GBq Kr-79) the original assumptions were re-evaluated in light of evidence of overheating of the target canisters, which included bulging end windows and discoloration marks on the target barrels. The root cause was determined to be overheating resulting from reduced cooling water flow to the windows, which put too much mechanical stress on the windows. The flow reduction was in turn determined to have resulted from changes made to the cooling system during the previous winter shutdown. Based on analyses of the release profiles that take into account the wind direction over the duration of the releases, the first release is estimated to have a maximum dose impact to a member of the public of 60 nSv, the second 11 nSv. Their combined impact to member of the general public corresponded to less than 1/12,000 of the regulatory limit.</p>  <p>Corrective actions included:</p>  <ul>  <li>Updates to the expected air monitor alarm response for the main control room operators</li>  <li>Installation of air monitor read-outs and alarm annunciation at the BL2C STF hot cell</li>  <li>Adoption of a requirement to have a formal decision-making process for authorizing the resumption of irradiations following a target failure</li>  <li>Adoption of a requirement to review any proposed changes to the system configuration prior to adoption, in particular any potential safety-related implications</li>  <li>Consideration of changes to the target and target holder design to make it more robust against the effects of overheating.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>December 12, 2019: Improperly sealed Type A container; damaged Type A container (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#12933)</strong></p>  <p>This incident actually comprises two separate dangerous occurrences per the <em>Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations</em>. In the first incident the lock ring that secures the lid to the outer container of a (borrowed) Type A container, came open from casual contact in the Toronto Airport Air Canada freight handling facility. The container has a mechanism to prevent such occurrences but it was not used. The subsequent investigation determined that this was due to incomplete knowledge of the proper use of the container by the people who packed it. The second incident occurred after the lid had been replaced and secured in the intended manner, when the container fell while being loaded onto the plane, suffering irreparable damage. There were no radiation exposure to the worker or to the public and there were no releases to the environment resulting from these two incidents.</p>  <p>Corrective actions included revision of TRIUMF&#8217;s shipping protocols to prevent the use of any Type A containers for which TRIUMF does not possess proof of the package&#8217;s certification for its intended use, and instructions for using it correctly. Additionally, improvements were specified to training for people involved in making radioactive shipments to ensure that everyone understands the requirements and has the necessary training credentials to allow them to perform such work.</p>  <p><strong>January 20, 2020: Unexpectedly high quarterly dose for a TRIUMF NEW for third quarter of 2019 (TRIUMF non-compliance report NCR#13001)</strong></p>  <p>The Q3, 2019 Landauer badge reading for a technician working in the ISAC experimental hall indicated a dose of 9.2 mSv had been incurred in Q3, 2019. Only one plausible source was suggested that could have led to the dose, exposure to x-rays while working underneath electrostatic dipoles at the DRAGON facility when the high voltage was turned on. The root cause investigation findings were that the facility Safety Analysis Report (SAR) indicated neither engineered nor administrative controls that would have<br/>
mitigated this hazard under the circumstances pertaining at the time of the incident. Corrective actions included a requirement to have a physical barrier in place to prevent access to the space immediately underneath the chambers any time they are at high voltage, and that this requirement be reflected in the DRAGON Facility SAR. These requirements also apply to EMMA which utilizes similar electrostatic  dipoles.</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>TRIUMF staff filled internal non-compliance reports for each of the events above and implemented corrective and preventive actions to prevent reoccurrence. The six accidental releases of radioisotopes, the two transport container incidents, the fire incident and the 12.5 kV power line strike were immediately reported to CNSC as required by the regulation. TRIUMF also reported the latter two incidents to WorkSafeBC. None of the incidents resulted in injuries. The six accidental releases of radioisotopes resulted in an estimated maximum dose impact to the public of 120 nSv (1/8,000 of the regulatory limit), taking into account the wind direction over the duration of the releases. The high quarterly dose for a NEW for the third quarter of 2019 was below TRIUMF action level and therefore, TRIUMF did not immediately report this event to CNSC. TRIUMF provided information and corrective actions surrounding this event within the 2019 ACR as required.</p>  <h3 id="appx-L-2">L.2 CLSI</h3>  <p><strong>March 15, 2018: Access to the Free Access Zone by former user</strong></p>  <p>A former user was able to gain facility access into the Free Access Zone. The person was identified promptly and escorted from the facility. Improvements to facility access process have been made to prevent the risk of a recurrence of this type of event.</p>  <p><strong>June 24, 2018: Failure of electron gun</strong></p>  <p>The high voltage power supply for the electron gun failed. Repairs were undertaken but the issue was not able to be resolved. Further investigation revealed significant damage occurred to several of the gun components and resulted in the machine being down for a 6- month period (July to December). The repairs were completed by mid-December and gun operation was restored on December 20.</p>  <p><strong>February 17, 2019: Leak of 30% ethylene glycol in sewer system</strong></p>  <p>An isolation joint for pump WP0105.1-22 ruptured leaking ~5,000 liters of 30% ethylene glycol in the sewer system. The pump was shut down, the isolation joint was repaired and glycol/water mixture was replaced into the system. The spill was considered a reportable event by the CNSC. The spill was also reported to the University of Saskatchewan, City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Spill Report Centre, and Environment Canada. CNSC Staff was satisfied with CLSI corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence. Such releases are diluted in the sewer system and are treated by the municipal water treatment plant prior to discharge. Therefore, the risk to the environment is minimal.</p>  <p><strong>May 1, 2019: Faulty active area radiation monitoring system</strong></p>  <p>The Active Area Radiation Monitoring System (AARMS) alarmed and interlocked at an incorrect value of 1.8 &#956;Sv cumulative dose on AARM1502-01. The AARMS should alarm at 25&#956;Sv as per design parameters for that location. The issue was found to be a factor of the AARMS Verification &amp; Validation (V&amp;V) testing that occurred a week earlier during preparations for accelerator startup. During the V&amp;V process, inspectors change the values of the programmable logic controller (PLC) to simulate alarm conditions. The setpoint was properly set in the Input/Output controller but that setting was not replicated in the PLC. A provision to have the Controls Engineer verify the continuity of setpoints after a V&amp;V has been completed and is now in place.</p>  <p><strong>June 7, 2019: Security related event.</strong></p>  <p>Prescribed information withheld from publication.</p>  <p><strong>June 21, 2019: Beam on without the full minimum complement</strong></p>  <p>Due to a scheduling error a Floor Coordinator did not arrive by the 8:00 am scheduled start time for the shift. The outgoing Floor Coordinator contacted HSE On-Call and was told to contact the Operator Lead, who supervises the operator group. The Supervisor did not answer so a message was left regarding the situation. At approximately 09:30 the Supervisor retrieved the message and made arrangements for the On-Call Floor Coordinator to fill in for the remainder of the shift. The On-Call Floor Coordinator arrived at 10:17 am. The remainder of the shift ran without incident. No safety concerns were noted as a result of the incident. Operators were trained to be clear that in the event the full minimum complement is not on &#8211;site, the beam must be turned off.</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>CLSI staff reported each of these incidents using the licensee&#8217;s internal reporting mechanism. Corrective and preventative actions were taken to prevent reoccurrence.</p>  <h2 id="appx-M">Appendix M: Compliance Rating Level</h2>  <p>The following rating levels, as shown in table 26, reflect the transition in rating terminology used by the CNSC.
